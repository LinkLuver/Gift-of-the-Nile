 gotn_events_2_title:0 "The Fourth Intermediatary Period"
 gotn_events_2_desc:0 "#E #Y 27th Dynasty, Akhetaton#!#!\nThe great Dynasty of #E Atenkheper I#! has fallen into utter #E Isfet#!. Political fragmentation resulted in independent Nomes all across Egypt. Soon, a #E 28th Dynasty#! formed to take over the mantle. The #E 28th Dynasty#! succeeded in further weakening the Pharoah in #E Akhetaton#!, and would have completely taken over if not for the opportunistic #E Menfer Nome#! foiling #E Henen-Nesut's#! dynastic plans. And due to this, even Upper Egypt would fragment, resulting in a recent new #E 29th Dynasty#! to appear on the Southern Border, following the traditional #E Kemetic#! faith. By the strength of #E Aten#!, the #E 27th Dynasty#! hopes to re-establish control, however the dying kingdom is surrounded by all sides by enemies.\n\n#E #Y 28th Dynasty, Henen-Nesut#!#!\nThe Dynasty at #E Henen-Nesut#! rose to prominence from the crumbling #E 27th Dynasty#!. They would quickly pose a threat to the #E 27th Dynasty#! after conquering #E Shedet#! followed soon after by conquering the most prosperous areas of the #E Faiyum#!. They then were able to use this momentum to invade into #E Menfer#! to take the prestigious city for themselves, and proceed to conquer much of the delta. Soon after, #E Pseneros Nome#! and #E Per-Medjet Nome#! would shift their allegiance to the new power. However, #E Menfer Nome#! would not last long under #E Faiyumic#! control. Conflicts over the #E Atenic#! religion of the #E Faiyum#! arose, resulting in the #E Nomarchy of Menfer#! gaining independence, cutting off all control of the delta.\n\n#E #Y Nomarchy of Menfer#!#!\n#E Menfer Nome#! would revolt against the #E 28th Dynasty#! of the #E Atenic Faiyumics#! in #E Henen-Nesut#!. They were able to exude their own influence in the now fractured #E Nile Delta#! region and have attained a position of power that equals that of a #E Pharonic Dynasty#! in their own right. #E Menfer Nome#! now has an opportunity to reunite #E Lower Egypt#! and proclaim their own #E 30th Dynasty of Egypt#!, however, the #E 28th Dynasty#! will look to return #E Menfer Nome#! to their own realm. The two rivals are of similar strengths, so only time will tell which will fall and which will rise.\n\n#E #Y 29th Dynasty, Waset#!#!\nThe #E Dynasty of Waset#! remains a bulwark of #E Kemetic#! faith for the #E Egyptian#! people. It was able to assert claim and influence over the old possessions of the #E 27th Dynasty#! in Nubian lands. However, the #E Nubians#! just up the Nile are none too keen of the upstart #E Wasetans#!. #E The 27th Dynasty#! also retains influence over the Nomes east of the Nile, putting serious strain on the #E Wasetic#! influence over the east. Reuniting #E Upper Egypt#! under their banner would surely legitimize their proper rule over #E Egypt#!.\n\n#E #Y Kingdoms of Kush#!#!\nThe once powerful #E Kingdom of Kush#! has fallen to civil war. The old #E Kerman#! elite are revived in #E Lower Nubia#!. The new #E Meroe#! based state sits in #E Upper Nubia#!. And sandwiched between lay #E Napata#!, trying to take advantage of any opportunity given. Will #E Kush#! reunite and take advantage of the weakened #E Egyptians#!, or be doomed to nothing but squabbling states to be controlled by #E Kemet#!."

However, if the calm waters boil over, it will mean a war between the mighty #E Persians#! and the powerful #E Babylonians#!."
