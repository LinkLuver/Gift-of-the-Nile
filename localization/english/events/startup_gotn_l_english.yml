 gotn_events_1_title:0 "Clash of the Cradle"
 gotn_events_1_desc:0 "#E #Y Median Empire#!#!\nThe #E Medians#! are the most dominant power in the entire known world, or so they were. After losses to the thorn in their side that is #E Achaemenid Persia#!, the #E Medians#! continue to lose influence in both west and east. Their troubles have only begun, as #E Armenia#! looks for any opportunity to turncoat, and the #E Saggartians#! look to leave the #E Median#! sphere for their #E Masdayasna#! brothers in #E Persia.#!\n\n#E #Y Achaemenid Kingdom#!#!\nDescended from the triumphant rebellion of #E Cyrus the Good#!, the #E Achaemenids#! have carved a realm out of the eastern satrapies that were once in the possession of the treacherous #E Medians#!. They have also begun to show their influence in the #E Persian Gulf#!, an endeavor that has left them quite at odds with the #E Babylonians#! to the west. Furthermore, their #E Elamite#! satrap refuses to help in any wars that don't involve them being granted territory... yet the last territory they want is #E Anshan#! itself.\n\n#E #Y Babylonian Kingdom#!#!\nThe #E Babylonians#! should have replaced the #E Assyrians#! on the world stage, yet failure to completely destroy the #E Assyrian Empire#! has come to bite the #E Babylonians#!. The #E Assyrians#! have only further declined, and they are now so weak that the #E Qedarites#! and #E Cardukoi#! have carved parts of their realm for themselves! Yet #E Babylon#! remains with hands tied behind their back, forced to tend to their #E Dilmunite#! colony against the #E Persian#! menace's influence.\n\n#E #Y Satrapy of Elam#!#!\nHas never once been happy with their share of the land. They would side against the #E Persians#! in the great #E Achaemenid#! civil war, switching sides at the promise of land being granted to them. Every time the #E Babylonians#!, #E Medians#!, or #E Achaemenids#! decide to war, the #E Elamites#! would take bribes on whether to fight or not. But what shall happen when the #E Elamites#! finally break free of all overlordship. It may be time for a new empire to arise!\n\n#E #Y Assyrian Empire#!#!\nThe #E Assyrians#! have faced centuries of decline. Slowly, they lost their influence over the #E Hebrew#! realms. In the next 50 years, the #E Damascans#! and #E Hamathi#! found independence. Then another half century, and #E Assyrian#! influence over #E Syria#! was nominal at best. Finally, the tribes from the deserts and the mountains alike came to carve their realms where #E Assyria#! once was. Even #E Nineveh#! fell, and for 30 years, it remained outside #E Assyrian#! control. Luckily, the fiddling kingdoms and empires of #E Media#!, #E Persia#!, #E Babylon#!, and #E Elam#! have had their backs turned, and we were able to reestablish a powerbase. What comes next is up to lord #E Asshur#!."

 gotn_events_2_title:0 "The Fourth Intermediatary Period"
 gotn_events_2_desc:0 "#E #Y 27th Dynasty, Akhetaton#!#!\nThe great Dynasty of #E Atenkheper I#! has fallen into utter #E Isfet#!. Political fragmentation resulted in independent Nomes all across Egypt. Soon, a #E 28th Dynasty#! formed to take over the mantle. The #E 28th Dynasty#! succeeded in further weakening the Pharaoh in #E Akhetaton#!, and would have completely taken over if not for the opportunistic #E Menfer Nome#! foiling #E Henen-Nesut's#! dynastic plans. And due to this, even Upper Egypt would fragment, resulting in a recent new #E 29th Dynasty#! to appear on the Southern Border, following the traditional #E Kemetic#! faith. By the strength of #E Aten#!, the #E 27th Dynasty#! hopes to re-establish control, however the dying kingdom is surrounded by all sides by enemies.\n\n#E #Y 28th Dynasty, Henen-Nesut#!#!\nThe Dynasty at #E Henen-Nesut#! rose to prominence from the crumbling #E 27th Dynasty#!. They would quickly pose a threat to the #E 27th Dynasty#! after conquering #E Shedet#! followed soon after by conquering the most prosperous areas of the #E Faiyum#!. They then were able to use this momentum to invade into #E Menfer#! to take the prestigious city for themselves, and proceed to conquer much of the delta. Soon after, #E Pseneros Nome#! and #E Per-Medjet Nome#! would shift their allegiance to the new power. However, #E Menfer Nome#! would not last long under #E Faiyumic#! control. Conflicts over the #E Atenic#! religion of the #E Faiyum#! arose, resulting in the #E Nomarchy of Menfer#! gaining independence, cutting off all control of the delta.\n\n#E #Y Nomarchy of Menfer#!#!\n#E Menfer Nome#! would revolt against the #E 28th Dynasty#! of the #E Atenic Faiyumics#! in #E Henen-Nesut#!. They were able to exude their own influence in the now fractured #E Nile Delta#! region and have attained a position of power that equals that of a #E Pharonic Dynasty#! in their own right. #E Menfer Nome#! now has an opportunity to reunite #E Lower Egypt#! and proclaim their own #E 30th Dynasty of Egypt#!, however, the #E 28th Dynasty#! will look to return #E Menfer Nome#! to their own realm. The two rivals are of similar strengths, so only time will tell which will fall and which will rise.\n\n#E #Y 29th Dynasty, Waset#!#!\nThe #E Dynasty of Waset#! remains a bulwark of #E Kemetic#! faith for the #E Egyptian#! people. It was able to assert claim and influence over the old possessions of the #E 27th Dynasty#! in Nubian lands. However, the #E Nubians#! just up the Nile are none too keen of the upstart #E Wasetans#!. #E The 27th Dynasty#! also retains influence over the Nomes east of the Nile, putting serious strain on the #E Wasetic#! influence over the east. Reuniting #E Upper Egypt#! under their banner would surely legitimize their proper rule over #E Egypt#!.\n\n#E #Y Kingdoms of Kush#!#!\nThe once powerful #E Kingdom of Kush#! has fallen to civil war. The old #E Kerman#! elite are revived in #E Lower Nubia#!. The new #E Meroe#! based state sits in #E Upper Nubia#!. And sandwiched between lay #E Napata#!, trying to take advantage of any opportunity given. Will #E Kush#! reunite and take advantage of the weakened #E Egyptians#!, or be doomed to nothing but squabbling states to be controlled by #E Kemet#!."

However, if the calm waters boil over, it will mean a war between the mighty #E Persians#! and the powerful #E Babylonians#!."

And he has stolen the hearts of the #E Egyptians#! of #E Waset#!!\n\nBut now, #E Anpi#! (Anubis) awaits him with the feather of #E Ma'at#! in his hand. #E Pharaoh Siamun#! has been stuck with cancer. For a #E Pharaoh#! at his age, he must be prepared to make the journey. The funding of his tomb has begun in the hidden #E Necropolis#!."
