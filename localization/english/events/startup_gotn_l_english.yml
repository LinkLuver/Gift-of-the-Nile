 gotn_events_1_title:0 "Clash of the Cradle"
 gotn_events_1_desc:0 "#E #Y Median Empire#!#!\nThe #E Medians#! are the most dominant power in the entire known world, or so they were. After losses to the thorn in their side that is #E Achaemenid Persia#!, the #E Medians#! continue to lose influence in both west and east. Their troubles have only begun, as #E Armenia#! looks for any opportunity to turncoat, and the #E Saggartians#! look to leave the #E Median#! sphere for their #E Masdayasna#! brothers in #E Persia.#!\n\n#E #Y Achaemenid Kingdom#!#!\nDescended from the triumphant rebellion of #E Cyrus the Good#!, the #E Achaemenids#! have carved a realm out of the eastern satrapies that were once in the possession of the treacherous #E Medians#!. They have also begun to show their influence in the #E Persian Gulf#!, an endeavor that has left them quite at odds with the #E Babylonians#! to the west. Furthermore, their #E Elamite#! satrap refuses to help in any wars that don't involve them being granted territory... yet the last territory they want is #E Anshan#! itself.\n\n#E #Y Babylonian Kingdom#!#!\nThe #E Babylonians#! should have replaced the #E Assyrians#! on the world stage, yet failure to completely destroy the #E Assyrian Empire#! has come to bite the #E Babylonians#!. The #E Assyrians#! have only further declined, and they are now so weak that the #E Qedarites#! and #E Cardukoi#! have carved parts of their realm for themselves! Yet #E Babylon#! remains with hands tied behind their back, forced to tend to their #E Dilmunite#! colony against the #E Persian#! menace's influence.\n\n#E #Y Satrapy of Elam#!#!\nHas never once been happy with their share of the land. They would side against the #E Persians#! in the great #E Achaemenid#! civil war, switching sides at the promise of land being granted to them. Every time the #E Babylonians#!, #E Medians#!, or #E Achaemenids#! decide to war, the #E Elamites#! would take bribes on whether to fight or not. But what shall happen when the #E Elamites#! finally break free of all overlordship. It may be time for a new empire to arise!\n\n#E #Y Assyrian Empire#!#!\nThe #E Assyrians#! have faced centuries of decline. Slowly, they lost their influence over the #E Hebrew#! realms. In the next 50 years, the #E Damascans#! and #E Hamathi#! found independence. Then another half century, and #E Assyrian#! influence over #E Syria#! was nominal at best. Finally, the tribes from the deserts and the mountains alike came to carve their realms where #E Assyria#! once was. Even #E Nineveh#! fell, and for 30 years, it remained outside #E Assyrian#! control. Luckily, the fiddling kingdoms and empires of #E Media#!, #E Persia#!, #E Babylon#!, and #E Elam#! have had their backs turned, and we were able to reestablish a powerbase. What comes next is up to lord #E Asshur#!."

 gotn_events_2_title:0 "The Fourth Intermediatary Period"
 gotn_events_2_desc:0 "#E #Y 27th Dynasty, Akhetaton#!#!\nThe great Dynasty of #E Atenkheper I#! has fallen into utter #E Isfet#!. Political fragmentation resulted in independent Nomes all across Egypt. Soon, a #E 28th Dynasty#! formed to take over the mantle. The #E 28th Dynasty#! succeeded in further weakening the Pharaoh in #E Akhetaton#!, and would have completely taken over if not for the opportunistic #E Menfer Nome#! foiling #E Henen-Nesut's#! dynastic plans. And due to this, even Upper Egypt would fragment, resulting in a recent new #E 29th Dynasty#! to appear on the Southern Border, following the traditional #E Kemetic#! faith. By the strength of #E Aten#!, the #E 27th Dynasty#! hopes to re-establish control, however the dying kingdom is surrounded by all sides by enemies.\n\n#E #Y 28th Dynasty, Henen-Nesut#!#!\nThe Dynasty at #E Henen-Nesut#! rose to prominence from the crumbling #E 27th Dynasty#!. They would quickly pose a threat to the #E 27th Dynasty#! after conquering #E Shedet#! followed soon after by conquering the most prosperous areas of the #E Faiyum#!. They then were able to use this momentum to invade into #E Menfer#! to take the prestigious city for themselves, and proceed to conquer much of the delta. Soon after, #E Pseneros Nome#! and #E Per-Medjet Nome#! would shift their allegiance to the new power. However, #E Menfer Nome#! would not last long under #E Faiyumic#! control. Conflicts over the #E Atenic#! religion of the #E Faiyum#! arose, resulting in the #E Nomarchy of Menfer#! gaining independence, cutting off all control of the delta.\n\n#E #Y Nomarchy of Menfer#!#!\n#E Menfer Nome#! would revolt against the #E 28th Dynasty#! of the #E Atenic Faiyumics#! in #E Henen-Nesut#!. They were able to exude their own influence in the now fractured #E Nile Delta#! region and have attained a position of power that equals that of a #E Pharonic Dynasty#! in their own right. #E Menfer Nome#! now has an opportunity to reunite #E Lower Egypt#! and proclaim their own #E 30th Dynasty of Egypt#!, however, the #E 28th Dynasty#! will look to return #E Menfer Nome#! to their own realm. The two rivals are of similar strengths, so only time will tell which will fall and which will rise.\n\n#E #Y 29th Dynasty, Waset#!#!\nThe #E Dynasty of Waset#! remains a bulwark of #E Kemetic#! faith for the #E Egyptian#! people. It was able to assert claim and influence over the old possessions of the #E 27th Dynasty#! in Nubian lands. However, the #E Nubians#! just up the Nile are none too keen of the upstart #E Wasetans#!. #E The 27th Dynasty#! also retains influence over the Nomes east of the Nile, putting serious strain on the #E Wasetic#! influence over the east. Reuniting #E Upper Egypt#! under their banner would surely legitimize their proper rule over #E Egypt#!.\n\n#E #Y Kingdoms of Kush#!#!\nThe once powerful #E Kingdom of Kush#! has fallen to civil war. The old #E Kerman#! elite are revived in #E Lower Nubia#!. The new #E Meroe#! based state sits in #E Upper Nubia#!. And sandwiched between lay #E Napata#!, trying to take advantage of any opportunity given. Will #E Kush#! reunite and take advantage of the weakened #E Egyptians#!, or be doomed to nothing but squabbling states to be controlled by #E Kemet#!."

 gotn_events_3_desc:0 "#E The Gulf Wars#! are a series of wars sanctioned by the #E Achaemenid Kingdom#! and #E Babylonia#!.\n\nIf either power #E directly enters a war#!, the #E Gulf Region#! will likely be consumed by the flames of war. #E Dilmun#! and #E Maka#! will be able to conduct aggressive actions against each other #E without their overlord's influence#!. However, if the calm waters boil over, it will mean a war between the mighty #E Persians#! and the powerful #E Babylonians#!."

He has led our armies against the tyrants of the so-called divine light, #E Aten#!. He has captured the city of #E Swenett#! from the hands of encroaching #E Nubians#!. And he has stolen the hearts of the #E Egyptians#! of #E Waset#!!\n\nBut now, #E Anpi#! (Anubis) awaits him with the feather of #E Ma'at#! in his hand. #E Pharaoh Siamun#! has been stuck with cancer. For a #E Pharaoh#! at his age, he must be prepared to make the journey. The funding of his tomb has begun in the hidden #E Necropolis#!."

 gotn_events_8_title:0 "Calamity in Carthage"
 gotn_events_8_desc:0 "#E #Y Numidian Kingdom#!#!\n20 years ago, the newly created #E Numidian Kingdom#!, led by the mighty chief #E Ailymas Ailymasid#!, shattered the burgeoning #E Carthaginian League#!, nearly sacked #E Carthage#!, and pushed the Punics back to their coastal cities. Now, it appears that the #E Numidian Kingdom#! is on the verge of collapse. Who could have seen that the mighty nation, who had bested #E Carthage#!, and nearly sacked the city, is now on the precipice of a great change?\n\n#E #Y Carthage#!#!\nEver since the height of #E Carthaginian power#! their mighty empire has been collapsing and rotting from the inside. Multiple tyrannical takeovers undermined the republic, and strong men, oligarchs, and cowards have become increasingly influential. Their own subjects forced the #E Carthaginians#! to accept their demands of free government, and formed a league with the #E Carthaginians#!. The #E Carthaginian League#!, after a disastrous battle at #E Bulla Regia #! against the invading #E Numidian Kingdom #!, had no choice but to retreat behind their massive walls and hope for the best. The #E Numidians#! lay siege to the great city of  #E Carthage#! for 2 years, and nearly succeeded, if it was not for a relief army led by the #E Amphipolian#! mercenary general #E Apollodorus#!, who famously hid his cavalry in the hills near #E Carthage#!, and while the #E Numidian#! army was sleeping, he sallied out with his cavalry, and decimated a large majority of the #E Numidian#! army in one cavalry charge. However, the #E Numidian#! army was massive, outnumbering the defenders nearly 6 to 1, and a protracted battle was fought on the plains outside #E Carthage#!. It was rumored that #E Apollodorus#!, after losing his horse to an arrow in the chest, personally defeated twenty seven #E Numidian warriors#!, with only his sword, before succumbing to his wounds. When the dust settled, the casualties numbered in the several thousands, on both sides. With the #E Punic#! and #E Numidian#! armies both devastated, a peace was quickly signed, with #E Carthage#! granting huge concessions to the #E Numidians#! in exchange for fair treatment of #E Punics#! in #E Numidian#! land, and guarantee of a 30 year peace. 17 years into the peace, an unsuccessful revolt of #E Punic#! subjects against #E Numidia#! was supported by #E Carthage#!. This revolt failing was a huge blow to #E Carthage#!, as they lost massive amounts of gold and manpower. With many of the elite of #E Carthage#! seeing #E Carthage#! as a lost cause, thousands of wealthy and influential #E Carthaginian#! citizens have left for more safe territories, such as #E Nura#! and #E Malacca#!. It seems #E Carthage#! is nearing complete annihilation. The only question is; who will be destroyed first, the #E Numidians#!, or the #E Carthaginians#!?\n\n#E #Y Nura#!#!\n#E Nura#!, the #E Punic#! colony on #E Sardinia#!, has become the most powerful #E Punic#! power. With #E Carthage#! nearly destroyed, and any other city too small or weak to accomplish anything, #E Nura#! has taken the mantle of the protector of the #E Punics#!. The #E Nuran#! capital city of #E Karali#!, has grown prosperous and wealthy. Unrest with the #E Sardinian#! tribes in the north might threaten this uncertain peace, and if a second #E Numidian-Carthaginian#! war occurs, #E Nura#! is sure to be drawn in.\n\n#E #Y Heraklea Aphrike#!#!\n2 years prior, the tyrant #E Izamramsem#! seized control of the city of #E Heraklea Aphrike#!, claiming to be the human incarnation of #E Herakles#!. His fanatical followers will follow him anywhere in battle, and it seems that he has been gathering strength for a large campaign. The tyrant surely has his sights on the prosperous city of #E Kalathousa#!, and to the #E Spanian#! cities to the north.\n\n#E #Y Malaca#!#!\nThe foremost #E Punic#! colony in the west, the heavily #E Iberian#!-influenced #E Spanians#! of #E Malaca#! have grown tremendously wealthy from the iron and gold mines. Another destination for #E Punics#! fleeing the #E Numidian#! conquered lands, #E Malaca#! has seen a sizable increase in population. Will #E Malaca#! defend their #E Spanian#! brethren against the imminent #E Heraklean#! invasion or will they be content to sit on their piles of gold?..."
