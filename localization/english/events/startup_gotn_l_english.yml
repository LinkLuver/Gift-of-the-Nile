 gotn_events_2_title:0 "The Fourth Intermediatary Period"
 gotn_events_2_desc:0 "#E #Y 27th Dynasty, Akhetaton#!#!\nThe great Dynasty of #E Atenkheper I#! has fallen into utter #E Isfet#!. Political fragmentation resulted in independent Nomes all across Egypt. Soon, a #E 28th Dynasty#! formed to take over the mantle. The #E 28th Dynasty#! succeeded in further weakening the Pharoah in #E Akhetaton#!, and would have completely taken over if not for the opportunistic #E Menfer Nome#! foiling #E Henen-Nesut's#! dynastic plans. And due to this, even Upper Egypt would fragment, resulting in a recent new #E 29th Dynasty#! to appear on the Southern Border, following the traditional #E Kemetic#! faith. By the strength of #E Aten#!, the #E 27th Dynasty#! hopes to re-establish control, however the dying kingdom is surrounded by all sides by enemies.\n\n#E #Y 28th Dynasty, Henen-Nesut#!#!\nThe Dynasty at #E Henen-Nesut#! rose to prominence from the crumbling #E 27th Dynasty#!. They would quickly pose a threat to the #E 27th Dynasty#! after conquering #E Shedet#! followed soon after by conquering the most prosperous areas of the #E Faiyum#!. They then were able to use this momentum to invade into #E Menfer#! to take the prestigious city for themselves, and proceed to conquer much of the delta. Soon after, #E Pseneros Nome#! and #E Per-Medjet Nome#! would shift their allegiance to the new power. However, #E Menfer Nome#! would not last long under #E Faiyumic#! control. Conflicts over the #E Atenic#! religion of the #E Faiyum#! arose, resulting in the #E Nomarchy of Menfer#! gaining independence, cutting off all control of the delta.\n\n#E #Y Nomarchy of Menfer#!#!\n#E Menfer Nome#! would revolt against the #E 28th Dynasty#! of the #E Atenic Faiyumics#! in #E Henen-Nesut#!. They were able to exude their own influence in the now fractured #E Nile Delta#! region and have attained a position of power that equals that of a #E Pharonic Dynasty#! in their own right. #E Menfer Nome#! now has an opportunity to reunite #E Lower Egypt#! and proclaim their own #E 30th Dynasty of Egypt#!, however, the #E 28th Dynasty#! will look to return #E Menfer Nome#! to their own realm. The two rivals are of similar strengths, so only time will tell which will fall and which will rise.\n\n#E #Y 29th Dynasty, Waset#!#!\nThe #E Dynasty of Waset#! remains a bulwark of #E Kemetic#! faith for the #E Egyptian#! people. It was able to assert claim and influence over the old possessions of the #E 27th Dynasty#! in Nubian lands. However, the #E Nubians#! just up the Nile are none too keen of the upstart #E Wasetans#!. #E The 27th Dynasty#! also retains influence over the Nomes east of the Nile, putting serious strain on the #E Wasetic#! influence over the east. Reuniting #E Upper Egypt#! under their banner would surely legitimize their proper rule over #E Egypt#!.\n\n#E #Y Kingdoms of Kush#!#!\nThe once powerful #E Kingdom of Kush#! has fallen to civil war. The old #E Kerman#! elite are revived in #E Lower Nubia#!. The new #E Meroe#! based state sits in #E Upper Nubia#!. And sandwiched between lay #E Napata#!, trying to take advantage of any opportunity given. Will #E Kush#! reunite and take advantage of the weakened #E Egyptians#!, or be doomed to nothing but squabbling states to be controlled by #E Kemet#!."

 gotn_events_4_desc:0 "#E #Y The Gulf Wars#!#! are a series of wars controlled by the #E #R Achaemenid Kingdom#!#! and #E #G Babylonia#!#!.\n\nIf either power #E directly enters a war#!, the #E Gulf Region#! will likely be consumed by the flames of war. #E Dilmun#! and #E Maka#! will be able to conduct wars against each other #E without their overlord's influence#!. However, either overlord will also be able to #E intervene#! at any point.\n\nThe history of the region has been tumultuous. Both the #E Babylonians#! and the #E Persians#! have been boxed in by deserts, mountains, and hostile powers. And they have both taken to the sea to expand their influence. While the region remains cold for now, the peace is anything but calm. With land being gobbled up by #E Makan#! and #E Dilmun#!, the last two states of the gulf now bear arms against each other in the name of their respective overlords, threatening this gulf conflict to turn very hot very quickly."
