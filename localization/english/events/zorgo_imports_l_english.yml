 me_zorgoomni.31_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has heard the call of glory and wants to personally lead some of our warriors on a raid into the lands of our enemies. The omens have spoken clearly, and [aggressive_neighbor.GetName] would be an easy target for our men to despoil - we have nothing to fear!"
 me_zorgoomni.31.a: "The time has come to teach [aggressive_neighbor.GetName] a lesson"
 me_zorgoomni.31.b: "On second thought, I do not have time for this"

 me_zorgoomni.32_title: "The Raid Into [aggressive_neighbor.GetName]"
 me_zorgoomni.32_desc_1: "The gods were with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] lead the raiding party into [aggressive_neighbor.GetName], for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] warriors were able to slip pass the [aggressive_neighbor.GetAdjective] border guards undetected. Our raiders were able to plunder many small towns and villages without any resistance from an organized force, and our men stole as much gold and silver from the people of [aggressive_neighbor.GetName] as they could carry.\n\nStores of grain, religious statues carved out of ivory and silver, luxurious furs, and even horses and slaves were taken as prizes - anything that was not taken away was set to the torch. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] returned home to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] at the head of a triumphant party that had tripled in size, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] saddlebags filled to bursting with all manner of ill-gotten gains."
 me_zorgoomni.32_desc_2: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] was able to lead the raiders from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] into the hinterlands of [aggressive_neighbor.GetName] without encountering any major resistance - the few unlucky border guards that crossed our paths were quickly sent to whatever gods they believed in.\n\nThe raid itself was quick and methodical, and our warriors wasted no time in spreading out and setting farms and towns to the torch. Civilians were struck down in the streets of their villages, and our soldiers carried off as much wealth as they could carry."
 me_zorgoomni.32_desc_3: "Our warriors were able to avoid the border guards of [aggressive_neighbor.GetName] without any problems and soon found themselves on the outskirts of a small but wealthy village - the buildings were made of brick and there were religious shrines made of marble in the center of a humble square.\n\nBy the time that the [aggressive_neighbor.GetAdjective] guards had any idea that their towns were being raided, our soldiers were already crossing back into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], having killed any in our way that would have raised an alarm."
 me_zorgoomni.32_desc_4: "Although we did not encounter any [aggressive_neighbor.GetAdjective] levies on our raid, our warriors did not find as much treasure as they had hoped for - the region seemed to be devoid of all wealth, picked over like a carcass on the steppe. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was a little disappointed in the results of the raid, but none of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] kinsmen were hurt or injured and we were able to steal from a few small farms."
 me_zorgoomni.32_desc_5: "Our warriors were able to raid a few tiny farms on the border between [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and [aggressive_neighbor.GetName], but the unexpected arrival of [aggressive_neighbor.GetAdjective] levies caused [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to call for a full retreat - the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] could not afford to lose any experienced soldiers, and the men had taken enough to satisfy themselves."
 me_zorgoomni.32_desc_6: "A few hours after [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] left [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] at the head of a raiding party, the weather had turned sour; a blistering rain storm appeared out of nowhere and refused to let up in its assault. Moods immediately darkened and travel became a miserable endeavor, and when it became apparent that it was only going to continue to get worse, everyone decided they would just rather go back to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 me_zorgoomni.32_desc_7: "Unfortunately for the raiders, they were not able to loot the countryside, for almost immediately upon crossing into [aggressive_neighbor.GetName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] men were attacked by ferocious [aggressive_neighbor.GetAdjective] soldiers on horseback.\n\nThankfully for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] prevailed in this desperate battle thanks to personal feats of glory - the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] killed three times as many as all others, causing many to look at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] in awe."
 me_zorgoomni.32_desc_8: "The gods were not with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] raiders, for a large group of [aggressive_neighbor.GetAdjective] soldiers set upon the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] as soon as the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] soldiers crossed the border.\n\nDozens of our men fell within seconds, pierced by countless arrows, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was shot in the thigh - a painful wound that made it difficult for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim] to ride and fight.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was separated from the riders by the enemy, but was able to eventually cross back into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] life - something that not all of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] companions could say."
 me_zorgoomni.32_desc_9: "In a disaster for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] raiders were attacked by a large force of [aggressive_neighbor.GetAdjective] guards, who slew many of our countrymen and took our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] prisoner.\n\nWhen the identity of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was discovered, the soldiers of [aggressive_neighbor.GetName] beat [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim] with a savage cruelty that nearly ended [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] life, and it was only with gold and promises that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was released alive."
 me_zorgoomni.32_desc_10: "At first, it seemed that the raiders under [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s lead had managed to slip across the border between [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and [aggressive_neighbor.GetName] without being seen, but a couple of hours later, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] warriors found themselves in a trap. The road narrowed down to meet a small bridge at the edge of a stream, and it was here that the [aggressive_neighbor.GetAdjective] launched an ambush that forced the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] raiders down into the water.\n\nAs dozens of arrows whizzed past [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] head, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] felt an overwhelming fear take ahold of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim], a paralyzing stupor that made [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] limbs freeze up; I'm about to die.\n\nWhen the end came, it was brutal."

 me_zorgoomni.33_desc: "My [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], we have terrible news to report from the [raided_settlement.GetName] settlement. Last night, a cohort of warriors from [nomadic_raid_country.GetName] slipped across our border and launched a surprise raid on the unsuspecting locals. It is known that the [nomadic_raid_country.GetAdjective] raiders killed some of our people and plundered their land, carting off whatever they could carry and burning everything that they could not.\n\nYou should know that these bandits were personally led by [nomadic_raid_country.GetRuler.GetName] in a brazen sign of disrespect to the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

 me_zorgoomni.36_desc: "One can see from the many foreign visitors to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] that the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are known far and wide for their prosperous civilization. Our merchants have never been happier, and the taxes that are taken from the rich citizens living within the capital have exceeded our expectations by a decent amount this year.

It was there that he found employment as a bodyguard working for one of the #E Stellaric Guildhouses#!, and after a few years of service aboard a trade ship, he decided to stay in [GetProvince('(int32)653').GetName] in order to join a mercenary company fighting in #E Arteon#!. While campaigning on the island, [SCOPE.sCharacter('random_warlock').GetFirstName] saved the life of an #E Ascendic Mage#! that agreed to teach the young man about the arcane arts, and the Master and Servant sailed for the [GetCountry('WGA').GetName] in order to search for an ancient manuscript in the libraries at [GetProvince('(int32)2720').GetName].\n\nSo why is he now in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]?
