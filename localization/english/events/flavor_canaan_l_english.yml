 flavor_canaan_100_desc:0 "As loyal subjects to the great lord, wandering Melqart, we are expected to pay tribute to the Temple of Melqart, as a remnant of our colonial past tribute to the mother city, Tyre. We are expected to pay every 5 years.\n\nGiving money to the temple will surely win favor with Melqart, however, it is far from necessary to do so. What shall we do?"
 flavor_canaan_100.a:0 "Spare no expense for Lord Melqart."
 flavor_canaan_100.b:0 "Lord Melqart will understand we're on a budget."
 flavor_canaan_100.c:0 "We refuse to pay a penny for this colonial tribute!"
