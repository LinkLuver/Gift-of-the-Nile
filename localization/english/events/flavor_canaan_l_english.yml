 flavor_canaan_100_title:0 "Tribute to Melqart"
 flavor_canaan_100_desc:0 "As loyal subjects to the great lord, wandering Melqart, we are expected to pay tribute to the Temple of Melqart, as a remnant of our colonial past tribute to the mother city, Tyre. We are expected to pay every 5 years.\n\nGiving money to the temple will surely win favor with Melqart, however, it is far from necessary to do so. What shall we do?"
 flavor_canaan_100.a:0 "Spare no expense for Lord Melqart."
 flavor_canaan_100.b:0 "Lord Melqart will understand we're on a budget."
 flavor_canaan_100.c:0 "We refuse to pay a penny for this colonial tribute!"

 flavor_canaan_2_title:0 "The One True God"
 flavor_canaan_2_desc:0 "The #E Hebrew#! faith is a divided one, with different kingdoms claiming different 'true gods.' To fully convert to this faith, we must decide which god is the truly true one. #E Yahweh#! of the Kingdoms of Israel and Samaria, #E Asherah#! of the Kingdom of Galilee, #E Chemosh#! of the Kingdom of Moab, #E Melkom#! of the Kingdom of Ammon, or #E Qaus#! of the Kingdom of Edom. We must choose carefully, as belief in one god means making yourself an enemy of all others!"
 flavor_canaan_2.a:0 "Yahweh, god of Israelites"
 flavor_canaan_2.b:0 "Asherah, goddess of Galilaeans"
 flavor_canaan_2.c:0 "Chemosh, god of Moabites"
 flavor_canaan_2.d:0 "Melkom, god of Ammonites"
