 omen_hermes_trismegistus:0 "Hermes Trismegistus"
 omen_hermes_trismegistus_desc:0 "#Y Greek God#! \nHermes Trismegistus, or Hermes the Thrice-Great, is a syncretism of the Greek messenger-god Hermes with the Egyptian god of wisdom, Thoth. Widely regarded by believers as a historical man, he is seen as an illustrious sage, a great natural philosopher and a consummate physician who defied death. Hermes Trismegistus is credited as the author of a large number of sebayt (Egyptian wisdom literature), often dealing with alchemical experimentation in the pursuit of immortality and higher wisdom. He has further been credited as the inventor of astronomy, astrology, the science of numbers, geometry, surveying, medicine, botany, civilized government, reading, writing, and oratory. He is frequently conflated with the 3rd Dynasty Egyptian priest Imhotep, or with one or other of the Hebrew prophets Moses and Enoch."

They say he will return together with Hermes Trismegistus when the time is right."

 ###PLATONISM
 deity_socrates:0 "$omen_socrates$"
 omen_socrates:0 "Socrates"
 omen_socrates_desc:0 "#Y Greek Philosopher#! \nSocrates is one of the greatest of the Greek philosophers and had a profound influence on everyone who came after him. According to his pupil Plato, Socrates claimed that the only thing he could truly know was his own ignorance and that true knowledge was impossible for humans to reach but that the pursuit of knowledge was inherently virtuous. Rather than teaching a fixed doctrine, Socrates used a novel dialectical method to seek truth. The Socratic method begins by seeking a definition of the subject and then proceeds to identify inconsistencies with regard to the definition by questioning, hoping to reach a new definition which is closer to absolute truth. Eventually, Socrates was put on trial for corrupting the minds of the young men of Athens and insulting the gods of the state. In an unsuccessful defence he claimed that he had been valuable to the state by stinging it like a gadfly in the service of divine truth, and that he could not have corrupted anyone since he would then have been in danger of being corrupted himself which no thinking person would want. He proposed that the city give him free food and housing as a 'punishment' for his services to truth, but instead the jury of citizens sentenced him to death by hemlock poisoning."

 omen_plato:0 "Plato"
 omen_plato_desc:0 "#Y Greek Philosopher#! \nPlato, born Aristocles, was a student of Socrates and one of the most influential philosophers of all time in his own right. In his best-known work,#E Politeia#!, also called the#E Republic#!, Plato makes use of characters including Socrates to expound on justice and virtue, to consider and dismiss various types of government - settling on rule by an enlightened Philosopher-King as the ideal political system - and to elaborate his theory of Forms, which he claims are the underlying essences of all things and the only sources of true knowledge. He likens the material world to shadows cast on a wall by objects in firelight, observed by prisoners in a cave who know no greater reality. The philosopher, then, is like a former prisoner who comes to understand the true nature of the shadows and experience higher knowledge - in the light of the Sun rather than the firelight inside - only after leaving the cave. In Plato's theory, the Form of the Good is the mysterious highest Form in existence, that which virtue seeks to replicate and of which knowledge results in justice."

 ###ORPHISM

 omen_pythagoras:0 "Pythagoras"
 omen_pythagoras_desc:0 "#Y Greek Philosopher#! \nPythagoras of Samos was a great philosopher, religious leader and polymath who founded the eponymous Pythagorean sect in Croton after studying in Egypt. He set out a communal, ascetic lifestyle for his followers, with the maxim 'all things in common among friends'. Pythagoras taught the doctrine of metempsychosis, the transmigration of souls, which may have led him to prescribe vegetarianism and the avoidance of fava beans. He is credited as a miracle-worker. He also taught belief in the music of the spheres, numerology, and mathematical perfection. Many of his specific teachings are unknown due to the vows of secrecy taken by the Pythagoreans, but it is likely that he emphasised the worship of Apollo."

 omen_hippasus_desc:0 "#Y Greek Philosopher#! \nHippasus of Metapontum was an early disciple of Pythagoras and a highly gifted mathematician who may have drowned at sea as a punishment from the gods for his discovery of irrational numbers.

 omen_zagreus_desc:0 "#Y Greek God#! \nZagreus is an Orphic version of Dionysus, reincarnated after his death at the hands of the Titans. The earliest mentions of this name in literature describe him as a partner of Gaia and call him the highest god. Aeschylus linked Zagreus with Hades, as either Hades' son or Hades himself, while others call him a son of Zeus with the mortal Selebe. Orphics venerate Zagreus/Dionysus as the creator of the human soul and the inspiration for human creativity."

 omen_anaxagoras_desc:0 "#Y Greek Philosopher#! \nAnaxagoras was a pre-Socratic philosopher who introduced the concept of Nous, the cosmic mind which orders the chaotic world. According to his teaching, all things have existed in some way from the beginning but originally existed in infinitesimally small fragments of themselves, endless in number and inextricably combined throughout the universe, requiring the Nous to bring them out of confusion. He also taught panspermia, the notion that life exists throughout the universe, and claimed that the Sun is a mass of hot metal and that the Earth is a flat disc floating on air."

 ###STOICISM

 omen_zeno:0 "Zeno"
 omen_zeno_desc:0 "#Y Greek Philosopher#! \nZeno or Zenon of Kition was a great moral philosopher of Phoenician ancestry, who moved from his native Cyprus to Athens and eventually founded the Stoic school (named after the Stoa Poikile, the colonnade of the agora where he taught) after studying under the Cynic philosopher Crates of Thebes. Zeno divided philosophy into three parts - logic, physics and ethics. He taught that there were four stages in the process of gaining knowledge - perception, sinkatathesis (assent), katalepsis (comprehension), and finally true knowledge which only a wise man can possess. In physics, influenced by Heraclitus, Zeno taught a pantheistic view of the universe as a divine reasoning entity which creates with aether (divine artisan-fire), and the unity of the human soul with the world-soul. In ethics, Zeno took the Cynic view of happiness as the single goal of life, originating from the alignment of one's reason with universal reason. Unlike the Cynics, Zeno argued that acts which are morally indifferent have value if they aid the natural instinct for self-preservation, distinct from happiness."

Pyrrho and his followers focused on developing methods to refute philosophical arguments rather than constructing counter-arguments, since arguing a viewpoint of one's own would impede the pursuit of ataraxia."
