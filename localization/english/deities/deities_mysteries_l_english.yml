 omen_hermes_trismegistus_desc:0 "#Y Greek God#! \nHermes Trismegistus, or Hermes the Thrice-Great, is a syncretism of the Greek messenger-god Hermes with the Egyptian god of wisdom, Thoth. Widely regarded by believers as a historical man, he is seen as an illustrious sage, a great natural philosopher and a consummate physician who defied death. Hermes Trismegistus is credited as the author of a large number of sebayt (Egyptian wisdom literature), often dealing with alchemical experimentation in the pursuit of immortality and higher wisdom. He has further been credited as the inventor of astronomy, astrology, the science of numbers, geometry, surveying, medicine, botany, civilized government, reading, writing, and oratory. He is frequently conflated with the 3rd Dynasty Egyptian priest Imhotep, or with one or other of the Hebrew prophets Moses and Enoch."

They say he will return together with Hermes Trismegistus when the time is right."

 ###PLATONISM

 omen_socrates:0 "Sokrates"
 omen_socrates_desc:0 "#Y Platonic Philosopher#! \nSocrates is one of the greatest of the Greek philosophers and had a profound influence on everyone who came after him. According to his pupil Plato, Socrates claimed that the only thing he could truly know was his own ignorance and that true knowledge was impossible for humans to reach but that the pursuit of knowledge was inherently virtuous. Rather than teaching a fixed doctrine, Socrates used a novel dialectical method to seek truth. The Socratic method begins by seeking a definition of the subject and then proceeds to identify inconsistencies with regard to the definition by questioning, hoping to reach a new definition which is closer to absolute truth. Eventually, Socrates was put on trial for corrupting the minds of the young men of Athens and insulting the gods of the state. In an unsuccessful defence he claimed that he had been valuable to the state by stinging it like a gadfly in the service of divine truth, and that he could not have corrupted anyone since he would then have been in danger of being corrupted himself which no thinking person would want. He proposed that the city give him free food and housing as a 'punishment' for his services to truth, but instead the jury of citizens sentenced him to death by hemlock poisoning."

 omen_plato:0 "Platon"
 omen_plato_desc:0 "#Y Platonic Philosopher#! \nPlato, born Aristocles, was a student of Socrates and one of the most influential philosophers of all time in his own right. In his best-known work,#E Politeia#!, also called the#E Republic#!, Plato makes use of characters including Socrates to expound on justice and virtue, to consider and dismiss various types of government - settling on rule by an enlightened Philosopher-King as the ideal political system - and to elaborate his theory of Forms, which he claims are the underlying essences of all things and the only sources of true knowledge. He likens the material world to shadows cast on a wall by objects in firelight, observed by prisoners in a cave who know no greater reality. The philosopher, then, is like a former prisoner who comes to understand the true nature of the shadows and experience higher knowledge - in the light of the Sun rather than the firelight inside - only after leaving the cave. In Plato's theory, the Form of the Good is the mysterious highest Form in existence, that which virtue seeks to replicate and of which knowledge results in justice."

 omen_aristotle_desc:0 "#Y Peripatetic Philosopher#! \nAristoteles, also called Aristotle, was a native of Stagira in Macedonia, but moved to Athens at a young age and studied under Plato for 20 years. After the death of Plato, Aristotle spent time studying the flora and fauna of Lesbos with Theophrastus before taking up a royal commission as tutor to Philip II of Macedon's young heir, the later Alexander III. Returning to Athens a decade later, Aristotle founded his own school at the Lykeion or Lyceum (a temple to the god Apollo Lykeios) where he lectured to the public and amassed scholarly texts in a great library. In philosophy, Aristotle is best known for his formalisation of syllogistic logic and his ontology of immanent realism which contrasts with Plato in asserting that universal forms are only what is present in every instance. He was famed for his systematic approach to natural philosophy, including studies in mechanics, optics, astronomy and biology."

 omen_speusippus_desc:0 "#Y Platonic Philosopher#! \nSpeusippos was one of Plato's most prominent students as well as his nephew. He took over leadership of the Academy following Plato's death but resigned after suffering a stroke some years later. He diverged significantly from his uncle's teachings, including in rejecting the theory of forms and the primacy of the Good. He was most interested in the differences between things and in categorising species of things, furthering the differentiation of branches of knowledge in order to more fully understand them. In contrast to Eudoxos, who identified the Good with pleasure, Speusippos identified the Good as being in between pleasure and pain."

 omen_xenocrates:0 "Xenokrates"
 omen_xenocrates_desc:0 "#Y Platonic Philosopher#! \nXenokrates of Chalkedon was a student of Plato who succeeded Speusippos as scholarch of the Academy. He attempted to develop Plato's theories, often using mathematical elements. He distinguished three forms of being - the sensible, the intelligible, and a third form combining the other two. He believed unity and duality to be gods which rule the universe, and the soul to be a self-moving number. He held that mathematical objects and ideals are identical, unlike Plato who distinguished them. He taught that virtue produces happiness but can be helped by external goods."

 omen_pythagoras:0 "Pythagoras"
 omen_pythagoras_desc:0 "#Y Pythagorean Philosopher#! \nPythagoras of Samos was a great philosopher, religious leader and polymath who founded the eponymous Pythagorean sect in Croton after studying in Egypt. He set out a communal, ascetic lifestyle for his followers, with the maxim 'all things in common among friends'. Pythagoras taught the doctrine of metempsychosis, the transmigration of souls, which may have led him to prescribe vegetarianism and the avoidance of fava beans. He is credited as a miracle-worker. He also taught belief in the music of the spheres, numerology, and mathematical perfection. Many of his specific teachings are unknown due to the vows of secrecy taken by the Pythagoreans, but it is likely that he emphasised the worship of Apollo."

 omen_zagreus_desc:0 "#Y Greek God#! \nZagreus is an Orphic version of Dionysus, reincarnated after his death at the hands of the Titans. The earliest mentions of this name in literature describe him as a partner of Gaia and call him the highest god. Aeschylus linked Zagreus with Hades, as either Hades' son or Hades himself, while others call him a son of Zeus with the mortal Selebe. Orphics venerate Zagreus/Dionysus as the creator of the human soul and the inspiration for human creativity."

 omen_isis_demeter:0 "Isis-Demeter"
 omen_isis_demeter_desc:0 "#Y Aegyptian Goddess#! \nThe cult of Isis-Demeter grew quickly as Egypt opened her delta to Greek settlers. They centered on Demeter's search for her daughter Persephone and Isis' search for Osiris' body. In her cult, she is considered to have done both, her escapades to the underworld making her the only god of the living to have frequented the land of the dead. She represents hope and love, as well as parental care and weather.

 omen_anaxagoras_desc:0 "#Y Pre-Socratic Philosopher#! \nAnaxagoras was a pre-Socratic philosopher who introduced the concept of Nous, the cosmic mind which orders the chaotic world. According to his teaching, all things have existed in some way from the beginning but originally existed in infinitesimally small fragments of themselves, endless in number and inextricably combined throughout the universe, requiring the Nous to bring them out of confusion. He also taught panspermia, the notion that life exists throughout the universe, and claimed that the Sun is a mass of hot metal and that the Earth is a flat disc floating on air."

 omen_zeno:0 "Zenon"
 omen_zeno_desc:0 "#Y Stoic Philosopher#! \nZeno or Zenon of Kition was a great moral philosopher of Phoenician ancestry, who moved from his native Cyprus to Athens and eventually founded the Stoic school (named after the Stoa Poikile, the colonnade of the agora where he taught) after studying under the Cynic philosopher Crates of Thebes. Zenon divided philosophy into three parts - logic, physics and ethics. He taught that there were four stages in the process of gaining knowledge - perception, sinkatathesis (assent), katalepsis (comprehension), and finally true knowledge which only a wise man can possess. In physics, influenced by Heraclitus, Zenon taught a pantheistic view of the universe as a divine reasoning entity which creates with aether (divine artisan-fire), and the unity of the human soul with the world-soul. In ethics, Zenon took the Cynic view of happiness as the single goal of life, originating from the alignment of one's reason with universal reason. Unlike the Cynics, Zenon argued that acts which are morally indifferent have value if they aid the natural instinct for self-preservation, distinct from happiness."

He led a turbulent life, being banished from his native Sinope for debasing currency and then moving to Athens where he lived as a beggar and slept in a large ceramic jar in the marketplace. From his marginal position in Athenian society he would mock and criticise social norms. Later, he was kidnapped by pirates and sold into slavery in Corinth.

She was born in Thrace but, after moving to Athens with her family, she fell in love with Krates who was already an established philosopher. She told her parents that she would kill herself if they kept her from marrying Krates. After marrying him she adopted male clothing, and the couple lived as equals.

He was the brother of Hipparchia, and one of the first to write Cynic morality stories or chreiai. According to legend, while a student at the Lyceum he farted while practising a speech and became so embarrassed by this that he attempted to starve himself to death. Krates visited Metrokles at home and told him that what he had done was natural and nothing to be ashamed of. To Cynics and Stoics, this anecdote demonstrates the worthlessness of conventional book learning prioritised by the Peripatetics."

Born in Thrace, he would produce 80 treatises on poetry, philosophy, Mesopotamian theology, and military tactics. Of course, he also was a proponent of ethics and existance. He would posit that atoms and the vacuum were the beginning of the universe; and that everything else existed only in opinion. He concluded that divisibility of matter comes to an end, and the smallest possible fragments must be bodies with sizes and shapes, although the exact argument for this conclusion of his is not known. The smallest and indivisible bodies he called atoms."

With Pyrrho, Anaxarchus would travel into Asia, perhaps contributing to his ideas as it did for Pyrrho. He is thought to be the linkage between Democritus' school of atomism and Pyrrho's school of Skepticism. He is also thought to have shared ethical ideas with Cyrenaic and Cynic schools. He wrote a work named About the Monarchs. In it, he spouses that knowledge is useless without the ability to know when to speak and what to say in every occasion."

 omen_nausiphanes_desc:0 "#Y Atomic Philosopher#! \nAn atomist philospher from Teos in Ionia, Nausiphanes argued that the study of natural philosophy (physics) was the best foundation for studying rhetoric or politics. Nausiphanes was an adherent of Democritus's sceptical side and deemed human judgment as being no more than a realignment of atoms in the mind. Nausiphanes substituted the term akataplêxia (“undauntability”) for Democritus’ athambiê, “fearlessness,” as crucial for eudaimonia. Epicurus was at one time one of his students, but was unsatisfied with him, and apparently abused him in his writings."

Influenced by Democritus, Aristippus, Pyrrho, and possibly the Cynics, he turned against the Platonism of his day and established his own school, known as "the Garden", in Athens.

She is best-known for her love poetry, which is often homoerotic. Other themes in the surviving fragments of her work include family and religion. She probably wrote poetry for both individual and choral performance. Most of her best-known and best-preserved fragments explore personal emotions and were probably composed for solo performance. Her works are known for their clarity of language, vivid images, and immediacy. The context in which she composed her poems has long been the subject of scholarly debate; the most influential suggestions have been that she had some sort of educational or religious role, or wrote for the symposium."

Homer's wisdom became so widely praised that he began to acquire the image of almost a prototypical philosopher."

Although little known outside the city, the residents claim it is Aeneus who has led the town to prosperity. The son of Aeneus, Cyzicus is perhaps more well known, as he founded the city of Cyzicus, and welcomed the Argonauts on their voyage to Colchis.

Tragically, Apollo had removed Patroclus' wits during the battle, and the spear of  Euphorbos struck him, and Patroclus was finished off by being stabbed in the stomach by the Trojan Prince Hector. Recently, a cult of Patroclus has become popular in the city of Illion."
