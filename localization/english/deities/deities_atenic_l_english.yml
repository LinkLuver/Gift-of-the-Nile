 omen_akhenaten_desc:0 "The messenger of the Aten, Akhenaten, is the most important of all the figuresin Antenism save the Aten itself. Akhenaten was heralded as an evil and oppressive figure to traditional Kemetic worshippers, but a savior to the newer cults around the Aten. Without Akhenaten, there is no Atenism. Who could imagine such a strange reality."

 omen_nefertiti_desc:0 "The important wife and successor to Akhenaten, Neferneferuaten was one of the most powerful women in all of Egyptian history. She would play a pivotal role in making sure Atenism was secured as a religion available not just to nobility, but to any Egyptian wishing to make it to the Land of Reeds."

 omen_tutankhaten_desc:0 "The late Tutankaten was said to have been chosen by the Aten for early depart from this life into the next. Although his reign was short, his rule would be largely controlled by ministers, many of those being Atenists. Thus, Atenism had yet another pivotal entrenchment in Egyptian society during this time."

 omen_atenhotep_desc:0 "Atenhotep was the final Pharaoh of the glorious 18th Dynasty. Although only distantly related, his role in the entrenchment of Atenism was perhaps the most important of all of the early Pharaohs of Aten. Not contributing much to the establishment of the religion itself, as he is unrelated to the direct line, he rolled back many aspects of Atenism making it more palpable to the masses who were still largely Kemetic worshippers. The restoration of certain defaced statues of divinities, a more liberal stance that was especially popular between the lands of Upper Egypt and the Delta, notably the Faiyum, and the selection of a Kemetic Pharaoh to succeed him. Without the one who makes Aten happy, there would likely be no one left to continue the legacies of Akhenaten, Neferneferuaten, and Tutankhaten."
