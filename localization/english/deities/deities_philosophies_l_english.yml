 omen_yajnavalkya_desc:0 "One of the Vedic Sages of the Brihadaranyaka, Yajnavalkya may have been the first proto-Ajnana scholar. Specifically, he argued for the impossibility of knowing the ultimate reality or the atman, ideas that would become inseperable from the Ajnana faith later. While it's a stretch to say he was the founder of Ajnana as an organized philosophy, his work, along with other aspects of scepticism in Vedicism, would serve as a prelude to Ajnana scepticism."

His teachings were a profound wellspring of wisdom, delving into the very essence of human existence. He expounded upon the principles of virtue, urging individuals to cultivate not only their minds but also their hearts. His ethical philosophy emphasized the importance of harmony, not only in society but within oneself, advocating for the unity of the inner and outer worlds.\n\nLi Kui's political acumen was informed by his philosophical insights, believing that a just and stable society could only be achieved through the harmonious coexistence of its parts.

Central to his philosophy were the principles of benevolence, frugality, and ethical leadership, which he considered fundamental pillars for the successful administration of a state.\n\nHaving served as the chief minister of the State of Zheng for an extended period, Zichan ardently believed that a ruler's foremost duty was to prioritize the well-being of the people. This core tenet of his philosophy emphasized the need for policies that would alleviate poverty, stimulate economic growth, and ensure fairness in resource distribution.

 omen_sun_wukong_desc:0 "#Y Chinese God#! \nSun Wukong, also known as Sun Wu Kong or Son Goku in Japanese, is among the most renowned figures in Chinese culture. He was worshipped across Eastern Asia as the celebrated Monkey King, a deity associated with agility, strength, and wit. Legend has it that he could effortlessly bear the weight of two heavenly mountains while moving at meteoric speeds. With a single somersault, he could traverse over 30,000 miles, and his memory was unparalleled, retaining the names of every monkey ever born.\n\nSun Wukong's fame extended far and wide due to his incredible journey to the west. In this epic odyssey, he embarked on a quest to obtain sacred scriptures, joined by his loyal companions, including the mischievous Pigsy and the monk Tripitaka. This journey, chronicled in the literary classic #E Journey to the West#!, is a testament to Sun Wukong's indomitable spirit and his transformation from a rebellious deity to a devoted guardian.\n\nThe origins of Sun Wukong have sparked numerous theories, with some of the earliest ones tracing back to the Chu Kingdom in 8th-century CE China. This era was rich in legends and myths featuring monkeys and gibbons, and these tales melded with local Taoist beliefs to shape an early rendition of the iconic Monkey King. It's also conceivable that Sun Wukong's legend predates this period, possibly emerging from the lore of other monkey deities found in the Fuzhou province, situated west of Taiwan. Throughout history, Sun Wukong has been depicted as both a Taoist and Buddhist figure, embodying the spiritual traditions of the region."

Central to his philosophy was the idea that individuals should seek to attain a state of natural spontaneity, transcending rigid social conventions and desires.\n\nZhuangzi often employed allegorical tales and anecdotes to illustrate his philosophical concepts, emphasizing the relativity of human perspectives and the illusory nature of distinctions between right and wrong. His contributions to Taoism are of paramount importance. Zhuangzi's writings, particularly#E The Zhuangzi#!, are considered foundational texts within Taoist thought. They explore themes of freedom, the relativity of truth, and the importance of embracing change as essential elements of the Taoist path. Zhuangzi's emphasis on the relativity of human perspectives and the illusory nature of distinctions between right and wrong deeply influenced the development of Taoist philosophy and its practical applications in areas such as meditation, martial arts, and holistic living."

Hailing from the state of Zheng, his life remains shrouded in mystery, with sparse historical records due in part to book burnings orchestrated by the Taoists themselves.\n\nSome scholars have entertained the intriguing possibility that Lie Yukou might have been a creation of the legendary Zhuangzi, an exemplar designed to embody the principles of Taoism. Despite the uncertainties surrounding his existence, the 'Liezi' remains a treasured Taoist text, delving into the profound concepts of the Tao, natural spontaneity, and the relativity of human perspectives. It continues to inspire seekers of the Way, contributing to the rich tapestry of Taoist philosophy."

He is known as the deity of 'Four Faces,' which speaks to his vision of a unity controlled in four directions. Chinese Taoists of this time often credited Huangdi as the originator of Taoist principles over Laozi. He is an immortal being of Taoism and existed far before Taoism was a school of thought. Huangdi existed as a Shenic god before Chinese Taoists would see him as a Taoist shen instead."

 omen_laozi:0 "Laozi"
 omen_laozi_desc:0 "#Y School of the Way#! \nLaozi, usually considered to be the founder of Taoism and the School of the Way, remains a semi-mythical figure. His major teachings are encapsulated in the foundational text of Taoism, the 'Tao Te Ching,' where he expounds upon profound concepts such as the Tao, Qi, and other fundamental principles of the Way.\n\nMost accounts state that Laozi was a contemporary of the philosophers of the Warring States period, like Confucius. Interestingly, Laozi's name, meaning 'The Old Master,' is an honorific title, while his actual name is a subject of ongoing debate, with possibilities including Er or Dan. Regardless of who he really was, Laozi's legacy endures through the timeless wisdom found in the Tao Te Ching, helping adherents understand the tenets of Taoism and the path to harmonious living until the modern day."

His major teachings emphasized the importance of adhering to principles and realities, meticulously scrutinizing laws, and establishing authoritative governance.\n\nDespite his talents and contributions, Deng Xi's personal code clashed with the policies of the Zheng state's higher officials, ultimately leading to his execution. One of Deng Xi's notable ideas revolved around the concept that a wise king is one who 'follows names and observes actualities, examines laws and establishes authority.' Deng Xi is chiefly remembered as a legal reformer who challenged traditional Confucian ideas, offering alternative perspectives that contributed to the evolution of governance and legal philosophy in ancient China."

He was considered the founder of the debatably mythically Xia Dynasty. He predates Mozi and his school of Mo by a thousand years, yet, some branches of Mohism believe that Yu the Great was an exemplar of Mohist doctrine and that Mohists should seek to emulate Yu. In fact, many Mohists believed it was their duty to follow in Yu the Great's altruism.\n\nIt is said that Mozi turned his back to the former Zhou dynasty. Instead, he would embrace the governenace of the Xia and of King Yu, as Mozi claimed that the doctrine of Jian Ai was practiced by the ancient sages and 6 kings."

 omen_yueyi_desc:0 "#Y School of Logicians#!\nGeneral Yue Yi was a legendary tactician, general, and diplomat prominent during the tumultuous Warring States period. He was born into a life of privilege in Yan, but his life took a dramatic turn when King Wuling of Zhao razed Yue Yi's hometown, forcing him into a life of a vagabond.\n\nFortune soon intervened when Yue Yi's exceptional talents captured the attention of King Zhao of Yan, who recognized his worth and gave him a job within his administration. Through expert diplomacy, Yue Yi orchestrated alliances with various states, including Wei, Chu, Han, Zhao, and Qin, uniting their forces to cripple the ascendant Qi. His leadership on the battlefield proved instrumental as he masterminded the downfall of Qi, leading to the exile of its ruthless king and nearly bringing the entire Qi territory under control.\n\nYue Yi was personally granted control over the region of Chang by his benefactor, King Zhao, but things rapidly changed following the sudden demise of King Zhao, leaving the state in chaos and Yue Yi without a patron. The Qi exploited this moment of weakness and recovered part of their lost territory, causing Yue Yi to flee to Zhao, fearing that the new King of Yan, Hui would lead the forces of Yan to total ruin. This soon came to pass, the Qi decimating the armies of the overconfident Yan. King Hui eventually managed to win Yue Yi over and was entrusted with sweeping powers. Thanks to Yue Yi's battlefield brilliance, the Yan managed to consolidate their holdings and avoided a total loss."
