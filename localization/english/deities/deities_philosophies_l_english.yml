 omen_purana:0 "Purana Kassapa"
 omen_purana_desc:0 "Purana Kassapa was the originator of the Niskriyavada sect. He was considered a great threat to Buddhism and likely contributed much hate from the Buddhists towards other shramanic faiths. Purana Kassapa also was the one to claim the three greatest of leaders were Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Sankiccha, and Makkhali Gosala. It is likely that this is because all three of those men must have been influential for the Ajivika sect and revolutionized it, especially Makkhali Gosala. Purana Kassapa contributed greatly towards the later Ajivika sect, however he never claimed to be a part of it. His followers would go on to found a more organized Niskriyavada sect.\n\nPurana Kassapa was the cheif monk at the monastry of monks at a place called Kukkutangara. He gained the epithet among his followers of 'the Lord of Puranan without comparison in intellegence.' Another epithet he gained was simply 'Puranan the Elder.' Purana Kassapa was of importance most to the Tamil Shramanics, who held him as the greatest of teachers.\n\nA story of the origin of Purana is filled with legend. Purana was said to have been born a slave, who was treated well. In spite of this, he ran away from his masters. In his run, thieves had stolen his clothes, and he had neither the will, nor the sense, to cover himself upon enterring a village. The villagers assumed he must have been a holy man, to have dressed with no clothes and in his pure form, called dharma-sata-pratticchana. Eventually, he embraced this nudity and refused clothes when offered and he would gain a following of 500 students."

 omen_niskriya:0 "Niskriya"
 omen_niskriya_desc:0 "The central belief of Purana Kassapa was Niskriyavada; the affrimation that the soul is passive, unaffected by the good or the bad done by us, the ultimate reality lying beyond good or evil. Here, you will likely find similarities with the Ajivika, and that is because of Purana's influence in the later sect, however, here this doctrine remains core to the Niskriyavada sect seperate to that of Ajivika beliefs. The main difference comes down to the Ajivika rejection of sin itself, while Niskriyavada simply states that the soul is naturally passive, but there is indeed good and bad done."

 omen_asama_desc:0 "Asama, a devaputta of remarkable presence, once visited the Buddha at Veluvana with his peers Sahali, Ninka, Akotaka, Vetambarī, and Mānava-Gamiya. Each devaputta was a fervent disciple of different teachers, and standing before the Buddha, they extolled the virtues of their respective masters. Asama's praise of Purana Kassapa, though sincere and passionate, was met with disfavor by the Buddha, who later regarded Purana Kassapa as misguided. Despite this, Asama's unwavering loyalty and courage in defending his teacher's honor earned him a place of respect among his peers, illustrating the complex interplay of faith and devotion in ancient spiritual landscapes."

 omen_yajnavalkya:0 "Yajnavalkya"
 omen_yajnavalkya_desc:0 "One of the Vedic Sages of the Brihadaranyaka, Yajnavalkya may have been the first proto-Ajnana scholar. Specifically, he argued for the impossibility of knowing the ultimate reality or the atman, ideas that would become inseperable from the Ajnana faith later. While it's a stretch to say he was the founder of Ajnana as an organized philosophy, his work, along with other aspects of scepticism in Vedicism, would serve as a prelude to Ajnana scepticism."

 omen_sanjaya_desc:0 "The so-called wanderer, Sanjaya Parabajjaka was the original teacher of the two later Buddhist disciples, Maha-Mogallana and Sariputta. He is considered the leading figure of the Ajnana philosophy as a contemporary to the Buddha. He is considered by many as the same figure as Sanjaya Belatthiputra, Sanjaya of the Belattha clan.\n\n'If you ask me if there exists another world (after death), if I thought that there exists another world, would I declare that to you? I don't think so. I don't think in that way. I don't think otherwise. I don't think not. I don't think not not.

# Sassatavada

 omen_maitreyi:0 "Maitreyi"
 omen_maitreyi_desc:0 "Maitreyi, from the 8th century BCE, was an Advaita philosopher mentioned in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. As the wife of sage Yajnavalkya, she discussed the nature of the soul (Atman) and ultimate reality (Brahman). Her dialogues highlight that true love connects to the soul. Maitreyi symbolizes the intellectual achievements of women in ancient India.\n\nToday, although she lived before the Sassatavada movement, she is identified as a Sassatavada precursor due to her connection of the Atman to love; the Atman ultimately becoming a part of the Anu Vaada which is one of two central beliefs of Sassatavada."

He was an atomist (pushed the idea of Anu Vaada) who believed in atomism which believed that everything is made of seven eternal elements – earth, water, fire, air, happiness, pain and soul. According to the Pali Canon, Kacayana was his family name and he is said to have belonged to a Brahmin caste. He was sometimes called Pakkudha Katiyana, or Kadhudha Katiyana. He would also popularize the belief of Sassatavada, or Sasvata-drst."
 deity_anuvada:0 "$omen_anuvada$"
 omen_anuvada:0 "Anu Vaada"
 omen_anuvada_desc:0 "Anu Vaada is the concept of the Atomic Theory as it was in Ancient Shramanic beliefs. Anu would literally come to mean atom or molecule while Vaada is a way of argument, or the concept of an argument itself; a theory. This early form of the Atomic Theory stipulated that the soul, or Atman, was made of an infinitisimally tiny particle repeated. This idea of the Anu would continue and be integrated into other Shramanic faiths like Ajivika, Vedic, and Jainist philosophies."

 omen_sassatavada_desc:0 "Sassatavada, or Sasvata-drst is the baseline bellief of the Sassatavada faith. It is best described as Eternalism, an idea that was utterly rejected by the foolish Buddha. Eternalism included the belief that the extinction of things means their latency and the production of things means their manifestation. One example of it is the belief that the individual has an unchanging self."

He was worshipped across Eastern Asia as the celebrated Monkey King, a deity associated with agility, strength, and wit. Legend has it that he could effortlessly bear the weight of two heavenly mountains while moving at meteoric speeds. With a single somersault, he could traverse over 30,000 miles, and his memory was unparalleled, retaining the names of every monkey ever born.\n\nSun Wukong's fame extended far and wide due to his incredible journey to the west. In this epic odyssey, he embarked on a quest to obtain sacred scriptures, joined by his loyal companions, including the mischievous Pigsy and the monk Tripitaka. This journey, chronicled in the literary classic #E Journey to the West#!, is a testament to Sun Wukong's indomitable spirit and his transformation from a rebellious deity to a devoted guardian.\n\nThe origins of Sun Wukong have sparked numerous theories, with some of the earliest ones tracing back to the Chu Kingdom in 8th-century CE China. This era was rich in legends and myths featuring monkeys and gibbons, and these tales melded with local Taoist beliefs to shape an early rendition of the iconic Monkey King. It's also conceivable that Sun Wukong's legend predates this period, possibly emerging from the lore of other monkey deities found in the Fuzhou province, situated west of Taiwan. Throughout history, Sun Wukong has been depicted as both a Taoist and Buddhist figure, embodying the spiritual traditions of the region."

Hailing from the state of Zheng, his life remains shrouded in mystery, with sparse historical records due in part to book burnings orchestrated by the Taoists themselves.\n\nSome scholars have entertained the intriguing possibility that Lie Yukou might have been a creation of the legendary Zhuangzi, an exemplar designed to embody the principles of Taoism.

Through expert diplomacy, Yue Yi orchestrated alliances with various states, including Wei, Chu, Han, Zhao, and Qin, uniting their forces to cripple the ascendant Qi. His leadership on the battlefield proved instrumental as he masterminded the downfall of Qi, leading to the exile of its ruthless king and nearly bringing the entire Qi territory under control.\n\nYue Yi was personally granted control over the region of Chang by his benefactor, King Zhao, but things rapidly changed following the sudden demise of King Zhao, leaving the state in chaos and Yue Yi without a patron. The Qi exploited this moment of weakness and recovered part of their lost territory, causing Yue Yi to flee to Zhao, fearing that the new King of Yan, Hui would lead the forces of Yan to total ruin. This soon came to pass, the Qi decimating the armies of the overconfident Yan. King Hui eventually managed to win Yue Yi over and was entrusted with sweeping powers.
