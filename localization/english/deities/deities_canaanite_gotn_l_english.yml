 omen_astarte_bast_desc:0 "Known as the Goddess of Kittens, she imbues the young with the ability of warfare and discipline while promoting parental values to those who would raise said young. She is a protective Goddess with a cult center found in the Tyrion Alashiyan colony of Kition. She is a syncretic Goddess between the deities of war, Astarte and Bastet. It is only fitting that her cult center is a place of unusual unity between Kemetic believers and Canaanite believers."
