 omen_akhenaten_desc:0 "The messenger of the Aten, Akhenaten, is the most important of all the figuresin Antenism save the Aten itself. Akhenaten was heralded as an evil and oppressive figure to traditional Kemetic worshippers, but a savior to the newer cults around the Aten. Without Akhenaten, there is no Atenism. Who could imagine such a strange reality."
