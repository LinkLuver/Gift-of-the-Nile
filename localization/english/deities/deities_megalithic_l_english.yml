 omen_ash:0 "Ash"
 omen_ash_desc:0 "#Y Ammonist God#! \nThe god Yush (Yuc), better known in Egypt as Ash, is known to many as the great god of the Libyans and Tehenu. In Egyptian mythology, Ash is associated with Set, and is a god of Oases in the western desert. He is usually depicted with many different faces of different desert animals such as a lion, vulture, hawk, snake, or Set animal. Some believe his origins lie in the city of Nebut due to one of his titles being 'He of Nebut.'\n\nIn Amazigh mythos, Yush is better known as the god of the sky. In the Garamantean Kingdom, many shrines to Yuc were made with brilliant displays of water. His worship may have been equal to that of Ammon in some cities."

The desert being a basic part of life for Siwans, Libyans, Souther Oasitae tribes, and the Garamantes, the worship of Setesh is quite common, perhaps more so that his land of origin."
