Mastoic also incorporates shamanist and naturalistic beliefs, especially through the Jhankri shamans, who channel spirits and deities.

This is the main idea of Carvaka, and thus, it is the most recognizably 'atheist' belief, comparable to Nihlism in modern-day times. Carvaka would have a renaissance of belief in the 7th century, resulting in its prolonged existence until the 12th century before it faded away."
