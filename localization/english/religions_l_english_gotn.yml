 ashur_religion:0 "Elishite"
 desc_ashur_religion:0 ""The Elishite faith of Assyria is set apart from its neighbors by the primacy of Assur-Enlil, the Lord of the Totality of Heaven and thus the source for all existence, earthly and divine. It also places heavy emphasis on the Assyrian kings as his viceroy on earth and the Assyrian Empire not merely as a state, but as an instrument of divine will. The extreme focus on the Assyrian monarchy does however limit the cult's spread in lands not heavily tied to the empire. Thus comes the name, 'The Way of the Heavens' (Elish)."

 sassatavada:0 "Sassatavada"
 desc_sassatavada:0 "Sassatavada is a philosophical and religious doctrine from ancient India, which asserts the eternal existence of the soul and rejects the concept of a transient, changing self.

Before it was a proper school of thought, Carvaka was a concept generally relating to the denial of the existence of an afterlife. This is the main idea of Carvaka, and thus, it is the most recognizably 'atheist' belief, comparable to Nihlism in modern-day times. Carvaka would have a renaissance of belief in the 7th century, resulting in its prolonged existence until the 12th century before it faded away."

 amun_religion:0 "Ammonist"

This tradition encompasses a wide range of esoteric beliefs, including the concepts of a divine, transcendent reality, the interconnectedness of all things, and the pursuit of spiritual knowledge. Hermeticism emphasizes the importance of achieving gnosis, or direct knowledge of the divine, through personal spiritual practice and mystical insight. Key principles include the idea of 'As above, so below,' suggesting that the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (the individual) reflect each other."

 stoicism:0 "Stoicist"
 desc_stoicism:0 "Of all the schools of ancient philosophy, Stoicism made the greatest claim to being utterly systematic. In the view of the Stoics, philosophy is the practice of virtue, and virtue, the highest form of which is utility, is generally speaking, constructed from ideals of logic, monistic physics, and naturalistic ethics. These three ideals constitute virtue which is necessary for 'living a well reasoned life', seeing as they are all parts of a logos, or philosophical discourse, which includes the mind's rational dialogue with itself. Of them, the Stoics emphasized ethics as the main focus of human knowledge, though their logical theories were of more interest for later philosophers."

 desc_uralic_pantheon:0 "Ilmaric represents the Finno-Ugric culture group's religion. It includes a vast array of cultures and beliefs, all revolving around the lead god, Ilma, who was most certainly venerated in all Finno-Ugric cultures.

They make offerings and libations in order to serve Mother Estan, and to keep the fields fertile to prevent celestial calamities from overwhelming the land."
