 aten_heritage:0 "Heritage of the 27th Dynasty"
 aten_heritage_desc:0 "Founded by the Prophet of the Aten, Atenkheper I, the 27th Dynasty was initially successful in its reinstatement of the Aten as the only true God of the Nile. Since its founding, the Pharaohs of the 27th have fallen far from her golden age, facing against rebel dynasties in either direction."
 henen_heritage:0 "Heritage of the 28th Dynasty"
 henen_heritage_desc:0 "Founded in the wake of political turmoil during the 27th Dynasty, the 28th dynasty was founded as a Faiyumic contender to the hardline Atenists in Akhetaton. However, the Nomarch of Menfer would betray the Phaoroah in Henen-Hesut, resulting in a collapse of control over the Delta region."
 hetan_heritage:0 "Heritage of the White Sands"
 hetan_heritage_desc:0 "The Hetan people, or the people of the white sands, have lived in their Oases, head of which in Farafra, have lived in the harsh conditions of the desert for hundreds of years. Their way of life remains unchanged even in the period of chaos they find themselves in now. With Khonsu as their witness, the moon glistens over the cold white sands brightly."
 deshretic_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Red Sands"
 deshretic_heritage_desc:0 "The Deshretic people, or the people of the red sands, find their homes between the rich oases of Sekht-Am and Farafra. The people are a heavy mix of Libyan and Oasitae Egyptians, resulting in an unruly and fierce warrior culture. They recently conquered Farafra and have had a taste of the sweet nectar and riches that they may look to rule over themselves."
 siwa_heritage:0 "Heritage of Siwa"
 siwa_heritage_desc:0 "The priests of Amun-Ra in Sekht-Am, or Siwa, have always remained under Pharonic control. The region of Siwa refers to not just the main Oasis of Sekht-Am, but also the nearby oases just north of the city. These oasis people, now, far from the ruling houses of Egypt, the Siwan Oases have to fend for themselves against both rival Egyptians and invading Libyans from the North, East, West, and South."
 sobek_aten_heritage:0 "Heritage of Sobek-Aten"
 sobek_aten_heritage_desc:0 "The Faiyumic people were amongst the first to accept the Aten, however, their belief of the Aten was syncrotized with their beloved Crocodilian god, Sobek. Sobek-Aten became the result of this fusion, giving the Faiyumic people their own special branch of Atenic faith, one where Sobek-Aten is the supreme Crocodile of Light."
 memphis_heritage:0 "Heritage of Memphis"
 memphis_heritage_desc:0 "Menfer Nome is only the most recent addition in the long legacy of states ruled from the city of Ptah. It has been the home to many other Nomarchs, Pharaohs, and golden ages of Egypt in its own right, and the newest state of Menfer is poised to brith a new era centered around the historic city."
 tenuwan_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Green Sea Merchants"
 tenuwan_heritage_desc:0 "While the majority of Egypt falls to chaos, the crafty merchants of the Green Sea see opportunity. Renouncing themselves as a Nomarchy severs their ties to a Pharonic rule, but opens up traderoutes with all who desire the riches of the Mediterranian."
 sais_heritage:0 "Heritage of Sais"
 sais_heritage_desc:0 "The city of Sao finds itself surronded by all sides by rebelling petty Nomarchs. Sao itself was home to many of the later Dynasties of Egypt, especially notable is the 26th Dynasty that was overthrown by the treacherous Atenic 27th Dynasty. Perhaps it is destiny for Sao to once again save Egypt from Isfet."
 mafkat_heritage:0 "Heritage of Turquoise Miners"
 mafkat_heritage_desc:0 "The miners of Mafkat, after the chaotic collapse of centralized authorities, find themselves far from any so called 'Dynasty' of Egypt. Thus, the Republic of Mafkat Khetiu was created, and the resulting state found itself a mix of native Arabian peoples and Egyptian workers. Their metalwork is exceptional and their blue stones are sold all throughout the seas at a bargain. In Mafkat Khetiu, they say that Turquoise is worth less than grain!"
 medjed_heritage:0 "Heritage of Medjed"
 medjed_heritage_desc:0 "Per-Medjed is a city dedicated to the mysterious god of death rites known as Medjed. He is said to protect the city even in spite of the Atenic presence that dominates it now. In fact, despite Atenism usually being opposed to local Kemetic deities, the exception is Per-Medjed Nome. Medjed coexists with their belief of the Aten, justified as Medjed existing in an area with no sun, under his veil, and in the Duat."
 peramun_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Gate to Egypt"
 peramun_heritage_desc:0 "The fortress of Per-Amun stands formidably between the easternmost edge of the black soils of Kemet and the barbarous lands of the Hyksos. As a result, the Nomarch of Per-Amun historically enjoyed a high stipend, but that all ended with the collapse of centralized authority. Still, the fortress stands and so too does Per-Amun's commitment as the gateway to Egypt."
 hyksos_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Neo-Hyksos"
 hyksos_heritage_desc:0 "Long, long after the collapse of the Age of Bronze, the Hyksos, or Phillistines, integrated themselves into the culture of the southern levant. However, during the heights of Late Kingdom Egypt, they were once more dubbed as Hyksos as they came under Egyptian influence. These 'Neo-Hyksos' have remained within the Egyptian sphere of influence even after the collapse of central authority. Whether or not they are descendents of the original Hyksos, their culture has deviated much from their Canaanite siblings to the north."
 bastet_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Temple of Cats"
 bastet_heritage_desc:0 "Per-Bastet Nome is known through the Delta as the site of the Great Temple of Bastet. The cat goddess is one of the most important among Kemetic worshippers, representing protection, perfume, warfare, arts, and of course, cats. Strolling through the streets of Per-Bastet, one can expect to see many of Bastet's children skimperring around, often being given treats by priests and working citizens alike."
 iunu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Pillars of Atum"
 iunu_heritage_desc:0 "The city of Awnu, also called Iunu, is famous for two landmarks. The Pillars of Atum, representing the primary cult-site for the great god of creation, and also the Wetjes Aten, a beautiful temple dedicated to the Aten, translated as 'The Elevated Aten,' built by Akhenaten himself. Both Atum and Aten are worshipped in the city, but it is certainly safe to say the Aten has taken over the majority of the identity that was once associated with Atum."
 huwaret_heritage:0 "Heritage of Avaris"
 huwaret_heritage_desc:0 "The Avarites were once known as enemies and foreigners to Egypt, but by now, the Avarites represents a slew of eastern Deltan Egyptians. The city of Avaris was superceded by that of Pi-Ramesses, but it has recently come into revival thanks to the Hut-Waret Nome investing heavily into the city."
 djanet_heritage:0 "Heritage of Tanis"
 djanet_heritage_desc:0 "Taking over from the city of Pi-Ramesses, Dja'Net, or Tanis, became the most important city in the eastern Delta area. It served as the capital for multiple dynastie of Egypt. Despite having a bit of a decline, during the better days of the Late Kingdom period, Dja'Net quickly began to rise as a prominent city once more. In the 4th Intermediate Period, it's positioned well to capitalize on the chaotic situation."
 wadjet_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Eye of the Moon"
 wadjet_heritage_desc:0 "The city of Per-Wadjet, also known as Buto, is a relatively ancient town associated with the worship of the goddess of the moon, Wadjet. The snake-bodied goddess both act as a protection goddess as well as a goddess of motherhood and a goddess of love. Upon unification with Nekhbet, she is considered the protector to all of Egypt, but in this divided time, the worship of Wadjet becomes evermore prominent."
 taremu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Fish Land"
 taremu_heritage_desc:0 "Once the seat of power during the third intermediatary period, the 'Land of Fish' has always remained of lesser relevance than its surrounding contemporary cities. Despite this, foreigners tend to refer to Taremu as instead a land of lions, invoking a much fiercer idea of its people. These fishermen have some bite to them, that's for certain."
 mendes_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Ram"
 mendes_heritage_desc:0 "The city of Djedet, also called Per-Banebdjedet, simply Djedet, or Mendes, was dedicated to the Ram of Banebdjedet, or the Ba of Osiris. Also important is the goddess of fish and the consort to Djedet, Hatmehit, and their child Horus the Younger. This is an unusual telling of the origin of Horus, but it eximplifies the decentralized nature of mainstream Kemetic religion."
 sebennytos_heritage:0 "Heritage of a New Start"
 sebennytos_heritage_desc:0 "Sebennytos, or Tjeb-Netjer as we know it as in Egyptian, is one of the newer cities within the Delta. If Egypt were unified, Tjeb-Netjer may indeed be a seat of power to consider. The city's name translates to 'The City of the Calf,' fitting for such a young but promising city. It is home to a prominent cult of Anhur and his spouse Mehit, but the city is primarily devoted to Aten worship. A newer religion for a newer city."
 naukratis_heritage:0 "Heritage of Sun Dancing"
 naukratis_heritage_desc:0 "The shores of Per-Merit are often flushed with foreigners. Dancing, singing, and partying. It's no surprise, the city being named after the goddess Merit, the wife of Hapy, and the deity associated with singing. But it wasn't until the arrival of Atenic settlers from the Faiyum. Until that point, Atenism was considered rather lacking in all but architecture when it came to the arts, however upon its arival in Per-Merit, Sun Dances, Light Songs, and even murals and art essenuating the purity of the Aten."
 damanhur_heritage:0 "Heritage of Little Waset"
 damanhur_heritage_desc:0 "A recent nickname to the great city of Damanhur is 'Little Waset.' This is because of the Kemetic fundamentalism the city finds itself promoting. It is dedicated to some of the most prominent gods of Lower Egypt; Horus, Thoth, and many older gods. Calling it Little Waset is quite derogatory however, as the city itself is among the oldest in the Eastern Delta."
 khasut_heritage:0 "Heritage of Xois"
 khasut_heritage_desc:0 "Better known to us as Xois, the city of Khasut was the birthplace for many of the 14th dynasty's Pharaohs. Perhaps this is why the tend to have a reputation of snobbiness towards the other Egyptians in the Delta. Khasut is situated in a nice location for such a reputation, with no port directly to the city, its foreign population has always remained low, and native population soaring high and prosperous."
 rhakote_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Twin Cities"
 rhakote_heritage_desc:0 "The village of Rhakote and its constituent village of Wenmeri-Asar grew to prominence very recently. Out of all polities in the Delta, perhaps none are as newly risen as Rhakote and Wenmeri-Asar. The twin villages have developped in the chaos of the fourth intermediatary period, serving as a port especially popular amongst the Greeks abroad. Religion plays a smaller role, however, its Atenic faith is certainly notable, influencing its infrastructure and diplomatic alliegiences."
 beja_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Civilized Beja"
 beja_heritage_desc:0 "The Nome of Beja was created in Late Kingdom Egypt, migrants from the Beja tribes had made their homes between the Sea of Reversing Waters (Red Sea) and the Upper Egyptian Nile. Although they were vanquished, their presence was never reversed and they were made into an official Nomarch of Late Kingdom Egypt."
 sukkari_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Exiled Miners"
 sukkari_heritage_desc:0 "The Republic of Mafkat Khetiu had many royalists amongst their midst, many of whom were expelled to the settlement of Nahrukhaw. It eventually would become the seat of a modest trade city, declaring themselves a Nomarch to the 'true Pharaohs.' Who the true Pharaohs are is a good a guess yours as it is theirs."
 semna_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Migrant Merchants"
 semna_heritage_desc:0 "The Nome of Semna was established by the Nabatean traders coming across the sea. The Nome was originally native Egyptian, but it was internally dominated by Nabateans, who had grown so great in the desert, that they are now a defacto Nabatean Nomarch in all but name."
 faiyum_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Faiyumic Refuge"
 faiyum_heritage_desc:0 "The Pseneros is home to the deserts and badlads just outside the Faiyum area. No one would reasonably want to live in such a place, unless of course, for political refuge. After the Atenification of the Faiyum, several Kemetic priests began smaller settlements on the outskirts of the Faiyum. Eventually, Pseneros became the largest of these refuge settlements."

 #Levantine Heritages
 tadmor_heritage:0 "Heritage of Tadmor"
 tadmor_heritage_desc:0 "The Qedarite Confederation of Tadmor was established during the collapse of the Neo-Assyrian state. After the collapse, they were able to scramble together a small confederation of Qedarite tribes between Palmyra, or Tadhmor, and the upper Euphrates. Skirmishes with the Neo-Babylonia state were frequent, however ultimately, due to constant warfare in the east, Tadmor was allowed to develop into a powerful republic, adopting many traditions of the local Aramaic populations and solidifying their control over the southern edge of civilization."
 qidraya_heritage:0 "Heritage of Qidaraya"
 qidraya_heritage_desc:0 "The Qidri people of Qidraya entered into the region as migrations from the deserts increased during and after the Neo-Assyrian collapse. Emboldenned by the success of their brothers in Tadmor, who had just seized the prosperous city of Palmyra, the Qidri managed to carve out a place for themselves in the northern Hewbrew world, even taking cities in Galilee. They would adopt many Aramic traditions and keep friendly relations with the Aramic states in order to assure their position against future Israeli retaliations."
 adini_heritage:0 "Heritage of Resiliance"
 adini_heritage_desc:0 "The state of Bit Adini lead a powerful anti-Assyrian coalition, however they were quickly overwhelmed and lost all their allies. Despite this diplomatic isolation caused by the Assyrians, and constant defeats at the hands of the Assyrians, the Bit Adini kept getting back up. Now, in the wake of the Assyrian collapse, they once again have risen from defeat, this time with no Assyrian state able to rival them."
 hamath_heritage:0 "Heritage of the 12 Kings"
 hamath_heritage_desc:0 "The Neo-Assyrians once came to the state of Hamamth, demanding surrender, but all they got were blank stares and mighty walls. Hamath would remain a powerful thorn in the side of the Neo-Assyrians, assembling a key portion of the coalition of 12 Kings. The Neo-Assyrians would launch a campaign, claiming to have won pitched battles yet only managing to have proof of sacking a single capital. However, this was enough to cause the coalition to falter as all the greatest of Aramaic kings would fall to internal strife, leaving Hamath to be forced to sign a peace with the burgeoning Neo-Assyrians, and invaded by one of their own, Darmashq."
 aram_heritage:0 "Heritage of the True Aramaics"
 aram_heritage_desc:0 "The state of Aram, or as the Assyrians called them, Darmeshq, were the greatest threat to the legitimacy of the Neo-Assyrian Empire's claim to the levant and their adoption of the Aramaic script and language. As a result, the Neo-Assyrians would refuse to call them by the name of Aram. They remained the most powerful of the Aramaic states until their collapse while at war with the Assyrians, being swallowed up by the undying snake. But now that snake has proven death is inevitable, and Aram will show rebirth is too inevitable."
 agushi_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Wartorn Kingdom"
 agushi_heritage_desc:0 "When first invaded by the Great King Shalmeneser III the state of Bet Agush/Arpad quickly capitulated, but when the Assyrians fought against the coalition at Qarqar they took advantage of the Assyrian failure to achieve a decisive win and launched a revolt. Then the Assyrians invaded and brutally put down the rebellion forcing them back into compliance. While under Assyrian suzerainty they partitioned the state of Hamath and were allowed to establish a fairly notable kingdom including the city of Haleb (among many others), even going so far as to claim kingship over all of Aram. Eventually their state was destroyed by the Assyrians after forming an alliance with the Urartians to expel the Assyrian invaders."
 neo_hittite_heritage:0 "Heritage of Hattusa"
 neo_hittite_heritage_desc:0 "The many different Neo-Hittite states still remain intact, intermixing with the Arameans, yet still keeping their cultural identity. Although they have Anatolian origins, they're now much more like their Levantine contemporaries in all but language."
 hittite_heritage:0 "Hertiage of Karkamesh"
 hittite_heritage_desc:0 "The city-state of Karkamesh are the single state capable of claiming lineage to the anicent Hittite Empire. They have fallen far, and stopped existing for a while, but they remain an autonomous entity now under the Arameic state of Bit Adini."

 #Persia-Potamia Heritages
 elam_heritage:0 "Heritage of Elam"
 elam_heritage_desc:0 "The Elamites are a powerful entity that often neglects its role as a so-called 'Satrapy.' In reality, the Elamites act more as mercenaries with preferences, exchanging land for favors. They serve as the main sword to the Persians, while also acting as a major annoyance. In the past, Median and Babylonians alike have offered the Elamites money or land in exchange for their neutrality in wars against the Persians. Perhaps its time for the Elamites to officially become their own, independent state, rising like they did in ancient times to be the strongest. Truly, they earn their reputation as the Strongest of Satraps."

 #Anatolian Heritages
 arzashi_heritage:0 "Heritage of Arzasha"
 arzashi_heritage_desc:0 "The Arzasha are an Armenian group typically loyal to the Medians, or at least heavily influenced by them. In many ways, they are as Median as they are Armenian. Yet still, who are they to complain at the chance of freedom and masters of their own destinies, especially in face of a collapsing liege versus an ascendant liege."
 paphos_heritage:0 "Heritage of Paphos"
 paphos_heritage_desc:0 "It is said that Paphos is the name of the child of Aphrodite, a name befitting for the colony known throughout the lands as being the center of Aphrodite's Cult. The great temple built to Aphrodite in Paphos has stood the test of time, surviving skirmishes and wars fought against the Alashiyan Phoenecians whom the Paphos Cypriots share the isle with."
 lepetos_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kings of Alashiya"
 lepetos_heritage_desc:0 "The monarchy of Lepetos was established by a foreign Ugartic line. Before then, they were a simple colony, democratically elected individuals would become the Shopets of the state. However, upon the establishment of the monarchy, things would change, as the monarchy was built from the ground up. Peasants are kept entertained through the massive amount of wealth funnelled into the pockets of the king, and so long as the populace remains happy, the kingdom shall stay afloat."
 salamis_heritage:0 "Heritage of True Alashiyans"
 salamis_heritage_desc:0 "The original inhabitants of Alashiya were indeed the Alashiyans, or so it is thought by the Salamis colony. Although the Alashiyans are thought by some to be a remnant of an age long gone, the residents of Salamis believe themselves to be the direct descendents, unlike the other Neo-Alashiyan colonies that surround them who were colonized later by the mainland Phoenecians."
 kiti_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kittens"
 kiti_heritage_desc:0 "The colony of Kiti, otherwise known as Kition by the Greeks, has a long and storied history. From once being Greek ruled, to being conquered by Tyre (Tzur), or its historical interactions with the New Kingdom Egyptians as well as the Late Kingdom Egyptians. Each interaction gave them a unique piece to its culture. The Greeks give them their understanding of spearmen warfare, the Tyrions gave them their religion and their Neo-Alashiyan cultural identity. And the Egyptions gave them a reverence of cats, of which Kiti has the most of in all of Alashiya! They even have a local goddess with the name of Ashtartebast, a syncretic deity between Astarte and Bast."
