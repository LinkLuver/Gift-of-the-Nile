 tadmor_heritage:0 "Heritage of Tadmor"
 tadmor_heritage_desc:0 "The Qedarite Confederation of Tadmor was established during the collapse of the Neo-Assyrian state. After the collapse, they were able to scramble together a small confederation of Qedarite tribes between Palmyra, or Tadhmor, and the upper Euphrates. Skirmishes with the Neo-Babylonia state were frequent, however ultimately, due to constant warfare in the east, Tadmor was allowed to develop into a powerful republic, adopting many traditions of the local Aramic populations and solidifying their control over the southern edge of civilization."
 qidraya_heritage:0 "Heritage of Qidaraya"
 qidraya_heritage_desc:0 "The Qidri people of Qidraya enterred into the region as migrations from the deserts increased during and after the Neo-Assyrian collapse. Emboldenned by the success of their brothers in Tadmor, who had just seized the prosperous city of Palmyra, the Qidri managed to carve out a place for themselves in the northern Hewbrew world, even taking cities in Galilee. They would adopt many Aramic traditions and keep friendly relations with the Aramic states in order to assure their position against future Israeli retaliations."
