 #Egyptian Heritages
 aten_heritage:0 "Heritage of the 27th Dynasty"
 aten_heritage_desc:0 "Founded by the Prophet of the Aten, Atenkheper I, the 27th Dynasty was initially successful in its reinstatement of the Aten as the only true God of the Nile. Since its founding, the Pharaohs of the 27th have fallen far from her golden age, facing against rebel dynasties in either direction."
 henen_heritage:0 "Heritage of the 28th Dynasty"
 henen_heritage_desc:0 "Founded in the wake of political turmoil during the 27th Dynasty, the 28th dynasty was founded as a Faiyumic contender to the hardline Atenists in Akhetaton. However, the Nomarch of Menfer would betray the Phaoroah in Henen-Hesut, resulting in a collapse of control over the Delta region."
 hetan_heritage:0 "Heritage of the White Sands"
 hetan_heritage_desc:0 "The Hetan people, or the people of the white sands, have lived in their Oases, head of which in Farafra, have lived in the harsh conditions of the desert for hundreds of years. Their way of life remains unchanged even in the period of chaos they find themselves in now. With Khonsu as their witness, the moon glistens over the cold white sands brightly."
 deshretic_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Red Sands"
 deshretic_heritage_desc:0 "The Deshretic people, or the people of the red sands, find their homes between the rich oases of Sekht-Am and Farafra. The people are a heavy mix of Libyan and Oasitae Egyptians, resulting in an unruly and fierce warrior culture. They recently conquered Farafra and have had a taste of the sweet nectar and riches that they may look to rule over themselves."
 siwa_heritage:0 "Heritage of Siwa"
 siwa_heritage_desc:0 "The priests of Amun-Ra in Sekht-Am, or Siwa, have always remained under Pharonic control. The region of Siwa refers to not just the main Oasis of Sekht-Am, but also the nearby oases just north of the city. These oasis people, now, far from the ruling houses of Egypt, the Siwan Oases have to fend for themselves against both rival Egyptians and invading Libyans from the North, East, West, and South."
 sobek_aten_heritage:0 "Heritage of Sobek-Aten"
 sobek_aten_heritage_desc:0 "The Faiyumic people were amongst the first to accept the Aten, however, their belief of the Aten was syncrotized with their beloved Crocodilian god, Sobek. Sobek-Aten became the result of this fusion, giving the Faiyumic people their own special branch of Atenic faith, one where Sobek-Aten is the supreme Crocodile of Light."
 memphis_heritage:0 "Heritage of Memphis"
 memphis_heritage_desc:0 "Menfer Nome is only the most recent addition in the long legacy of states ruled from the city of Ptah. It has been the home to many other Nomarchs, Pharaohs, and golden ages of Egypt in its own right, and the newest state of Menfer is poised to brith a new era centered around the historic city."
 tenuwan_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Green Sea Merchants"
 tenuwan_heritage_desc:0 "While the majority of Egypt falls to chaos, the crafty merchants of the Green Sea see opportunity. Renouncing themselves as a Nomarchy severs their ties to a Pharonic rule, but opens up traderoutes with all who desire the riches of the Mediterranian."
 sais_heritage:0 "Heritage of Sais"
 sais_heritage_desc:0 "The city of Sao finds itself surronded by all sides by rebelling petty Nomarchs. Sao itself was home to many of the later Dynasties of Egypt, especially notable is the 26th Dynasty that was overthrown by the treacherous Atenic 27th Dynasty. Perhaps it is destiny for Sao to once again save Egypt from Isfet."
 mafkat_heritage:0 "Heritage of Turquoise Miners"
 mafkat_heritage_desc:0 "The miners of Mafkat, after the chaotic collapse of centralized authorities, find themselves far from any so called 'Dynasty' of Egypt. Thus, the Republic of Mafkat Khetiu was created, and the resulting state found itself a mix of native Arabian peoples and Egyptian workers. Their metalwork is exceptional and their blue stones are sold all throughout the seas at a bargain. In Mafkat Khetiu, they say that Turquoise is worth less than grain!"
 medjed_heritage:0 "Heritage of Medjed"
 medjed_heritage_desc:0 "Per-Medjed is a city dedicated to the mysterious god of death rites known as Medjed. He is said to protect the city even in spite of the Atenic presence that dominates it now. In fact, despite Atenism usually being opposed to local Kemetic deities, the exception is Per-Medjed Nome. Medjed coexists with their belief of the Aten, justified as Medjed existing in an area with no sun, under his veil, and in the Duat."
 peramun_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Gate to Egypt"
 peramun_heritage_desc:0 "The fortress of Per-Amun stands formidably between the easternmost edge of the black soils of Kemet and the barbarous lands of the Hyksos. As a result, the Nomarch of Per-Amun historically enjoyed a high stipend, but that all ended with the collapse of centralized authority. Still, the fortress stands and so too does Per-Amun's commitment as the gateway to Egypt."
 hyksos_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Neo-Hyksos"
 hyksos_heritage_desc:0 "Long, long after the collapse of the Age of Bronze, the Hyksos, or Phillistines, integrated themselves into the culture of the southern levant. However, during the heights of Late Kingdom Egypt, they were once more dubbed as Hyksos as they came under Egyptian influence. These 'Neo-Hyksos' have remained within the Egyptian sphere of influence even after the collapse of central authority. Whether or not they are descendents of the original Hyksos, their culture has deviated much from their Canaanite siblings to the north."
 bastet_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Temple of Cats"
 bastet_heritage_desc:0 "Per-Bastet Nome is known through the Delta as the site of the Great Temple of Bastet. The cat goddess is one of the most important among Kemetic worshippers, representing protection, perfume, warfare, arts, and of course, cats. Strolling through the streets of Per-Bastet, one can expect to see many of Bastet's children skimperring around, often being given treats by priests and working citizens alike."
 iunu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Pillars of Atum"
 iunu_heritage_desc:0 "The city of Awnu, also called Iunu, is famous for two landmarks. The Pillars of Atum, representing the primary cult-site for the great god of creation, and also the Wetjes Aten, a beautiful temple dedicated to the Aten, translated as 'The Elevated Aten,' built by Akhenaten himself. Both Atum and Aten are worshipped in the city, but it is certainly safe to say the Aten has taken over the majority of the identity that was once associated with Atum."
 huwaret_heritage:0 "Heritage of Avaris"
 huwaret_heritage_desc:0 "The Avarites were once known as enemies and foreigners to Egypt, but by now, the Avarites represents a slew of eastern Deltan Egyptians. The city of Avaris was superceded by that of Pi-Ramesses, but it has recently come into revival thanks to the Hut-Waret Nome investing heavily into the city."
 djanet_heritage:0 "Heritage of Tanis"
 djanet_heritage_desc:0 "Taking over from the city of Pi-Ramesses, Dja'Net, or Tanis, became the most important city in the eastern Delta area. It served as the capital for multiple dynastie of Egypt. Despite having a bit of a decline, during the better days of the Late Kingdom period, Dja'Net quickly began to rise as a prominent city once more. In the 4th Intermediate Period, it's positioned well to capitalize on the chaotic situation."
 wadjet_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Eye of the Moon"
 wadjet_heritage_desc:0 "The city of Per-Wadjet, also known as Buto, is a relatively ancient town associated with the worship of the goddess of the moon, Wadjet. The snake-bodied goddess both act as a protection goddess as well as a goddess of motherhood and a goddess of love. Upon unification with Nekhbet, she is considered the protector to all of Egypt, but in this divided time, the worship of Wadjet becomes evermore prominent."
 taremu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Fish Land"
 taremu_heritage_desc:0 "Once the seat of power during the third intermediatary period, the 'Land of Fish' has always remained of lesser relevance than its surrounding contemporary cities. Despite this, foreigners tend to refer to Taremu as instead a land of lions, invoking a much fiercer idea of its people. These fishermen have some bite to them, that's for certain."
 mendes_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Ram"
 mendes_heritage_desc:0 "The city of Djedet, also called Per-Banebdjedet, simply Djedet, or Mendes, was dedicated to the Ram of Banebdjedet, or the Ba of Osiris. Also important is the goddess of fish and the consort to Djedet, Hatmehit, and their child Horus the Younger. This is an unusual telling of the origin of Horus, but it eximplifies the decentralized nature of mainstream Kemetic religion."
 sebennytos_heritage:0 "Heritage of a New Start"
 sebennytos_heritage_desc:0 "Sebennytos, or Tjeb-Netjer as we know it as in Egyptian, is one of the newer cities within the Delta. If Egypt were unified, Tjeb-Netjer may indeed be a seat of power to consider. The city's name translates to 'The City of the Calf,' fitting for such a young but promising city. It is home to a prominent cult of Anhur and his spouse Mehit, but the city is primarily devoted to Aten worship. A newer religion for a newer city."
 naukratis_heritage:0 "Heritage of Sun Dancing"
 naukratis_heritage_desc:0 "The shores of Per-Merit are often flushed with foreigners. Dancing, singing, and partying. It's no surprise, the city being named after the goddess Merit, the wife of Hapy, and the deity associated with singing. But it wasn't until the arrival of Atenic settlers from the Faiyum. Until that point, Atenism was considered rather lacking in all but architecture when it came to the arts, however upon its arival in Per-Merit, Sun Dances, Light Songs, and even murals and art essenuating the purity of the Aten."
 damanhur_heritage:0 "Heritage of Little Waset"
 damanhur_heritage_desc:0 "A recent nickname to the great city of Damanhur is 'Little Waset.' This is because of the Kemetic fundamentalism the city finds itself promoting. It is dedicated to some of the most prominent gods of Lower Egypt; Horus, Thoth, and many older gods. Calling it Little Waset is quite derogatory however, as the city itself is among the oldest in the Eastern Delta."
 khasut_heritage:0 "Heritage of Xois"
 khasut_heritage_desc:0 "Better known to us as Xois, the city of Khasut was the birthplace for many of the 14th dynasty's Pharaohs. Perhaps this is why the tend to have a reputation of snobbiness towards the other Egyptians in the Delta. Khasut is situated in a nice location for such a reputation, with no port directly to the city, its foreign population has always remained low, and native population soaring high and prosperous."
 rhakote_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Twin Cities"
 rhakote_heritage_desc:0 "The village of Rhakote and its constituent village of Wenmeri-Asar grew to prominence very recently. Out of all polities in the Delta, perhaps none are as newly risen as Rhakote and Wenmeri-Asar. The twin villages have developped in the chaos of the fourth intermediatary period, serving as a port especially popular amongst the Greeks abroad. Religion plays a smaller role, however, its Atenic faith is certainly notable, influencing its infrastructure and diplomatic alliegiences."
 beja_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Civilized Beja"
 beja_heritage_desc:0 "The Nome of Beja was created in Late Kingdom Egypt, migrants from the Beja tribes had made their homes between the Sea of Reversing Waters (Red Sea) and the Upper Egyptian Nile. Although they were vanquished, their presence was never reversed and they were made into an official Nomarch of Late Kingdom Egypt."
 sukkari_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Exiled Miners"
 sukkari_heritage_desc:0 "The Republic of Mafkat Khetiu had many royalists amongst their midst, many of whom were expelled to the settlement of Nahrukhaw. It eventually would become the seat of a modest trade city, declaring themselves a Nomarch to the 'true Pharaohs.' Who the true Pharaohs are is a good a guess yours as it is theirs."
 semna_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Migrant Merchants"
 semna_heritage_desc:0 "The Nome of Semna was established by the Nabatean traders coming across the sea. The Nome was originally native Egyptian, but it was internally dominated by Nabateans, who had grown so great in the desert, that they are now a defacto Nabatean Nomarch in all but name."
 faiyum_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Faiyumic Refuge"
 faiyum_heritage_desc:0 "The Pseneros is home to the deserts and badlads just outside the Faiyum area. No one would reasonably want to live in such a place, unless of course, for political refuge. After the Atenification of the Faiyum, several Kemetic priests began smaller settlements on the outskirts of the Faiyum. Eventually, Pseneros became the largest of these refuge settlements."

 #Levantine Heritages
 tadmor_heritage:0 "Heritage of Tadmor"
 tadmor_heritage_desc:0 "The Qedarite Confederation of Tadmor was established during the collapse of the Neo-Assyrian state. After the collapse, they were able to scramble together a small confederation of Qedarite tribes between Palmyra, or Tadhmor, and the upper Euphrates. Skirmishes with the Neo-Babylonia state were frequent, however ultimately, due to constant warfare in the east, Tadmor was allowed to develop into a powerful republic, adopting many traditions of the local Aramaic populations and solidifying their control over the southern edge of civilization."
 qidraya_heritage:0 "Heritage of Qidaraya"
 qidraya_heritage_desc:0 "The Qidri people of Qidraya entered into the region as migrations from the deserts increased during and after the Neo-Assyrian collapse. Emboldenned by the success of their brothers in Tadmor, who had just seized the prosperous city of Palmyra, the Qidri managed to carve out a place for themselves in the northern Hewbrew world, even taking cities in Galilee. They would adopt many Aramic traditions and keep friendly relations with the Aramic states in order to assure their position against future Israeli retaliations."
 adini_heritage:0 "Heritage of Resiliance"
 adini_heritage_desc:0 "The state of Bit Adini lead a powerful anti-Assyrian coalition, however they were quickly overwhelmed and lost all their allies. Despite this diplomatic isolation caused by the Assyrians, and constant defeats at the hands of the Assyrians, the Bit Adini kept getting back up. Now, in the wake of the Assyrian collapse, they once again have risen from defeat, this time with no Assyrian state able to rival them."
 hamath_heritage:0 "Heritage of the 12 Kings"
 hamath_heritage_desc:0 "The Neo-Assyrians once came to the state of Hamamth, demanding surrender, but all they got were blank stares and mighty walls. Hamath would remain a powerful thorn in the side of the Neo-Assyrians, assembling a key portion of the coalition of 12 Kings. The Neo-Assyrians would launch a campaign, claiming to have won pitched battles yet only managing to have proof of sacking a single capital. However, this was enough to cause the coalition to falter as all the greatest of Aramaic kings would fall to internal strife, leaving Hamath to be forced to sign a peace with the burgeoning Neo-Assyrians, and invaded by one of their own, Darmashq."
 aram_heritage:0 "Heritage of Beth Hazael"
 aram_heritage_desc:0 "Having always been a major center of trade in the region, the city of Damascus would be brought to its greatest extent under the rule of the king Hazael. At its height it saw the closest any state has every come to the realization of a unified Aramanean state, holding dominion over Lugath and Hamath in the north and the Hebrew states to the south. Ultimately the kingdom would collapse after Hazael's death as it was faced with revolt among its vassals and Assyrian invasion."
 agushi_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Yahanu"
 agushi_heritage_desc:0 "The tribe of the Yahanu were among those who had migrated across the Euphrates during the collapse of the middle Assyrian Empire, but were quickly expelled by the rise of the Neo-Assyrians. The state of Beth Agush would be founded by many of these refugees. Ultimately the Neo-Assyrians caught up to them and forcefully brought them back into the fold, yet even under Neo-Assyrian rule they prospered and persevered eventually establishing a fairly wealthy kingdom and even daring to claim all of Aram. Ultimately they'd successfully expel the Assyrians with the aid of the Urartians, but that alliance proved shortlived as rival interests saw war break out over northern Aram."
 neo_hittite_heritage:0 "Neo-Hittite Heritage"
 neo_hittite_heritage_desc:0 "The many different Neo-Hittite states still remain intact, intermixing with the Arameans, yet still keeping their cultural identity. Although they have Anatolian origins, they're now much more like their Levantine contemporaries in all but language."
 hittite_heritage:0 "Hertiage of Karkamesh"
 hittite_heritage_desc:0 "The city-state of Karkamesh are the single state capable of claiming lineage to the anicent Hittite Empire. They have fallen far, and stopped existing for a while, but they remain an autonomous entity now under the Arameic state of Bit Adini."
 tyre_heritage:0 "Heritage of Tyre"
 tyre_heritage_desc:0 "The city of Tyre, said to have been founded in 2750 BCE, founded many great colonies in the western Mediterranean at the height of its power. Melqart was the primary deity worshiped in the city, with a priestly class and a grand temple dedicated to the god. The city itself is an island, connected to land by an isthmus that was built later on, with its impregnable walls defending the city. After centuries of colonization of the African coast, Tyrian influence has started to wane. After the Numidians confederated  and swiftly conquered most of what was formerly Carthaginian and other Punic territory, Tyre has no more influence in the region, except for the religious cult to Melqart that many Punic nations pay tribute to. Tyre must find a way to regain their position as a naval and colonial power."
 yadiya_heritage:0 "Heritage of Sem'el"
 yadiya_heritage_desc:0 "An ancient city of mixed Luwian-Aramaic composition with ties to earlier Ugarit, the rulers of Yadiya went to great lengths to ensure the state's stability and the prosperity of its people regardless of background. Eventually, the King Bar Rakab aligned with the Assyrians against his neighbors. This decision proved to be the state's demise as the collapse of Assyrian rule in the region, combined with popular unrest and an invasion by Gurgum saw the royal family exiled and a new dynasty imposed."
 ugarit_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Old City"
 ugarit_heritage_desc:0 "Ugarit was once the center of trade in the old world before the great collapsed. In it, the people of the sea would disrupt the old kingdom of Ugarit. However, even by then, the city had started in sharp decline. Our current dynastic house would migrate from the outskirts of the old kingdom and rebuild the city with a small group of nobles. Still far from what it once was, the Kingdom of Ugarit has survived, nonetheless, where many before it have dissapeared, been destroyed, or forgotten entirely."
 tripoli_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Betrayed"
 tripoli_heritage_desc:0 "The three cities of the Kingdom of Tripoli, now called as Bitron, 'Ator, and 'Arqo, were once three kings who had asked for the aid of Akhenaten long, long ago, against the nomad migrations. However, the help from Kemet never came. When the time came to reforge an alliance into a single state, these three cities called upon this ancient betrayal and founded the new triple-kingdom. Sandwiched between the greater cities of Byblos and Arados, this alliance proved strong and capable, even able to set out colonies of her own like mighty Tyre."
 beritos_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Fortified Port"
 beritos_heritage_desc:0 "The rather small port of Beritos, or known to the locals as Beirut/Berut, has one defining feature which has allowed her to maintain her independence against their much more influencial neighbors of Sidon and Byblos; her fortified port deemed untouchable by sea, even from the once great navy of Tyre. The market of Beritos has thus gained a grand reputation of security, for the whole of it exists within the fortified structure."
 acre_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Pheonixine City"
 acre_heritage_desc:0 "One of the great conquests of Thutmosis III, and having been burned during the times of the Assyrians for malcompliance, and even later, sacked by the Habiru Kingdom of Israel, the port of Akko refuses to be killed. They say that the city was founded for the first time before the first Pharaoh of Kemet even rose, before the times of Gilgamesh, before the great flood, and before the Greeks spoke Greek. And it has been put aflame numerous times, yet each time, Akko has risen from the ashes reborn. Today, it serves as one of the main ports carrying goods from the Nile Delta to the rest of Canaan."
 dor_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Tjeker"
 dor_heritage_desc:0 "The Egyptians have designated Dor as the people they once called the Tjeker; one of the dastardly Sea Peoples. Regardless of the truth of this, the Dorans have accepted this mythos as their truth, remaining the last of the so-called Neo-Hyksos outside of the Egyptian sphere. A rather small remnant it may be, but too are they fierce in their independence."
 alalakh_heritage:0 "Heritage of Alalakh"
 alalakh_heritage_desc:0 "The 2000 year history of the city of Alalakh has survived much. It has been part of countless leagues, kingdoms, and empires, yet her walls still protect her people. During the Assyrio-Urarat years, Alalakh went into decline, but, upon reemergence of its independence, the Syrion-Hittite Kingdom would once again surge in influence. This was largely due to its positioning between the lands of Syria and Cilicia. The two incredibly rich regions use Alalakh as a middleman in overland trade, while the twinports of Myriandros and Qaryim serve the purpose of local trade."

 #Persia-Potamia Heritages
 elam_heritage:0 "Heritage of Elam"
 elam_heritage_desc:0 "The Elamites are a powerful entity that often neglects its role as a so-called 'Satrapy.' In reality, the Elamites act more as mercenaries with preferences, exchanging land for favors. They serve as the main sword to the Persians, while also acting as a major annoyance. In the past, Median and Babylonians alike have offered the Elamites money or land in exchange for their neutrality in wars against the Persians. Perhaps its time for the Elamites to officially become their own, independent state, rising like they did in ancient times to be the strongest. Truly, they earn their reputation as the Strongest of Satraps."
 apphana_heritage:0 "Heritage of Prosperous Piracy"
 apphana_heritage_desc:0 "In 351 BCE, a wealthy group of Ionian merchants came to the King of Babylon with an unusal request- setting up an emporion on the island of Apphana, in exchange for the Ionian colony paying tribute to Babylon. Always looking for a chance to make more money, the Babylonians quickly agreed. However, the new colony attracted a little more than merchants- the island city became a hub for piracy, rivaling even the pirate infested ports of Cyrenica. The pirates have become a sort of privateer for the Babylonian kingdom, harrasing and plundering undefended towns along the Persian gulf. The islands location at the mouth of the Persian Gulf has made it into an important trade hub and a key strategic point. Goods from Arabia, India, and Persia flow in every day, ensuring the continued wealth of the emporion."
 gordyene_heritage:0 "Carduchii Heritage"
 gordyene_heritage_desc:0 "First noted as the Qardu tribal folk by the Urartian and Assyrian kingdoms of the Archaic Period, The Carduchii are a Caucasian-like people who are said to still, in part, worship the old Hurrian gods, unlike their southern brethren, the Qardu. Mighty warriors, the Carduchii have been the bane of empires, frequently raiding the Medians and Assyrians. Although neighboring empires have described them as simple tribesmen, the Carduchii have been known to build impressive siege equipment."
 qardu_heritage:0 "Qardu Heritage"
 qardu_heritage_desc:0 "The Qardu and Carduchii were once a united people, who dwelt in the northwestern Zagros. After decades of occupation by the Assyrians, the southern Qardu broke free from their overlords, establishing the Qardu Kingdom of Nineveh. Although they no longer control Nineveh, the Qardu became much like their former conquerors, and have adopted many Assyrian practices. In doing so, they seemed to have lost their tenacious warrior spirit."
 assyrian_empire_heritage:0 "Assyrian Empire Heritage"
 assyrian_empire_heritage_desc:0 "Once the greatest empire of its time, the Assyrian Empire suffered from revolts, invasions from other empires, and internal turmoil has forced the Assyrians to slowly retract back to their imperial heartland. Through a combination of luck, divine will, and the strong foundation of Assyrian bureaucracy, Assyria has managed to survive, and even reconquer some of its territory. Now, all who have wronged Assyria should be prepared to face Ashur's judgement."
 hurrian_heritage:0 "Hurrian Heritage"
 hurrian_heritage_desc:0 "Once widespread across the Northern Levant and Mesopotamia, the Hurrians had no difficulty syncretizing their beliefs with other religions, and adopted many cultural practices of the places they came to conquer. After the fall of the Mitanni, no great Hurrian power has risen since, resulting in the decline of their culture."
 
 #African Heritages
 heraklea_aphrike_heritage:0 "Heritage of The Cult of Herakles"
 heraklea_aphrike_heritage_desc:0 "The recent overthrow of the Republican government has led to the worship of the cult of Izamramsen. The might of Herakles seems to be with this nation, but they have had a difficult time persuading the old ruling class to cooperate with them."
 metagonia_heritage:0 "Heritage of the African Ionians"
 metagonia_heritage_desc:0 "No one is exactly sure how these Ionians traveled to the shores of Africa. When Massalian merchants began sailing to the coast of Africa, it is said that the Ionians were here first, before the other greeks and the Punics. A rather accepting people, they have gotten along well with the natives of the region, incorportating many Amizagh beliefs into their pantheon."
 tubaqatis_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Civilized Tribesmen"
 tubaqatis_heritage_desc:0 "After the Phoenicians settled near these lands, many tribesmen from the surrounding region settled here, as a way to capitalize on the Phoenician trade. They quickly adopted the ways of their more civilized neighbors, and they are not considered to be barbarians anymore by their Greek and Punic neighbors."
 kinyps_heritage:0 "Heritage of Prince Dorieus"
 kinyps_heritage_desc:0 "When this colony was founded by the Spartans in the Archaic period, they were nearly destroyed by an alliance of Libyans and the Punic settlers. The mighty walls they had constructed, and fresh reinforcements from their motherland allowed the Spartans to keep control of their land. Their descendants are isolationist, and prefer to sit behind their city gates, and leave the other Greeks, Punics, and Libyans to their own devices." 
 leptis_magna_heritage:0 "Heritage of Tetrapolitania"
 leptis_magna_heritage_desc:0 "The Phoenicians here were some of the first to establish a colony in Africa (some claim that it was the first). After the arrival of the Greeks, they found a way to co-exist, thus establishing Tetrapolitania as it was known by the Greeks."
 kalathousa_heritage:0 "Heritage of The Pillars"
 kalathousa_heritage_desc:0 "Coming to control the Pillars of Herakles with its sister nation Heraklea Aphrike in around 520, the city of Kalathousa became rich from commerce. So much so, that it was said that the streets were paved with gold, and that fruit was so plentiful that it was practically overflowing out of the markets. However, not much can be said about their martial ability, prefering to avoid conflict. Perhaps this was due to their love of feasting and sleeping frequently."

 #Anatolian Heritages
 arzashi_heritage:0 "Heritage of Arzasha"
 arzashi_heritage_desc:0 "The Arzasha are an Armenian group typically loyal to the Medians, or at least heavily influenced by them. In many ways, they are as Median as they are Armenian. Yet still, who are they to complain at the chance of freedom and masters of their own destinies, especially in face of a collapsing liege versus an ascendant liege."
 paphos_heritage:0 "Heritage of Paphos"
 paphos_heritage_desc:0 "It is said that Paphos is the name of the child of Aphrodite, a name befitting for the colony known throughout the lands as being the center of Aphrodite's Cult. The great temple built to Aphrodite in Paphos has stood the test of time, surviving skirmishes and wars fought against the Alashiyan Phoenicians whom the Paphos Cypriots share the isle with."
 lepetos_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kings of Alashiya"
 lepetos_heritage_desc:0 "The monarchy of Lepetos was established by a foreign Ugartic line. Before then, they were a simple colony, democratically elected individuals would become the Shopets of the state. However, upon the establishment of the monarchy, things would change, as the monarchy was built from the ground up. Peasants are kept entertained through the massive amount of wealth funnelled into the pockets of the king, and so long as the populace remains happy, the kingdom shall stay afloat."
 salamis_heritage:0 "Heritage of True Alashiyans"
 salamis_heritage_desc:0 "The original inhabitants of Alashiya were indeed the Alashiyans, or so it is thought by the Salamis colony. Although the Alashiyans are thought by some to be a remnant of an age long gone, the residents of Salamis believe themselves to be the direct descendents, unlike the other Neo-Alashiyan colonies that surround them who were colonized later by the mainland Phoenicians."
 kiti_heritage:0 "Heritage of Kittens"
 kiti_heritage_desc:0 "The colony of Kiti, otherwise known as Kition by the Greeks, has a long and storied history. From once being Greek ruled, to being conquered by Tyre (Tzur), or its historical interactions with the New Kingdom Egyptians as well as the Late Kingdom Egyptians. Each interaction gave them a unique piece to its culture. The Greeks give them their understanding of spearmen warfare, the Tyrions gave them their religion and their Neo-Alashiyan cultural identity. And the Egyptions gave them a reverence of cats, of which Kiti has the most of in all of Alashiya! They even have a local goddess with the name of Ashtartebast, a syncretic deity between Astarte and Bast."
 que_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Subachaeans"
 que_heritage_desc:0 "Established by Greek colonists and merchants amid the instability of the early Iron Age, Que soon came to dominate Cilicia. Although nowadays its Greek origins seem less apparent due to its prolonged exchange with Luwian and Canaanite neighbors it still maintains close ties with its Cypriot kin. It still possesses an extremely multicultural nature as the connection between the Canaanite, Greek, and Hittite worlds, with many from all three regularly pouring in and out."
 lesser_armenia_heritage:0 "Heritage of The Unruly Land"
 lesser_armenia_heritage_desc:0 "The lands of the Bronze Age Hayasa-Azzi confederation, it sits apart from and West of traditional, 'Greater' Armenia. Nestled against Pontus and Cappadocia, the inhabitants of Lesser Armenia retained a more Anatolian character, also having many Colchian and Lazi tribes inhabiting the interior lands - thus, the land was more diverse and unruly."
 sophene_heritage:0 "Heritage of Sophene"
 sophene_heritage_desc:0 "Ruled by members of a cadet branch of the Orontid dynasty, the kingdom of Sophene lies to the most western part of the land called 'Greater Armenia.' Nested within the mountain ranges of the Anatolia, the Anti-Tauros and the Tauros. At the crossroads between the lands of Armenia, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and the Iranian world, Sophene was quite cosmopolitan and Imperial Aramaic was used in government while Armenian was commonly spoken among much of the populace who worshipped Iranian cults at city and town-centers. It has always sat within the sights of power-hungry warlords in Armenia and to the west, and has since been embroiled in border conflicts."

 #Zagrosian Heritages
 cyrti_heritage:0 "Heritage of Predatory Brigands"
 cyrti_heritage_desc:0 "Long and difficult, are the nights on the mountains of the northern Zagros, yet behind any hill, one might find the infamous Cyrti. They would be categorized as Strabo by the title of Predatory Brigands, sacking traderoutes and remaining unconquerable by the larger 'civilized' folk around them. Assyrian, Persian, Median, or Urartu; no one can truly tame the aggressive mountain warriors."
 subartu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Smited"
 subartu_heritage_desc:0 "These people were said to have once ruled a mighty kingdom in Upper Mesopotamia before being destroyed by Eannatum of Lagash. However, the Shubar never lost their name, or so they claim. These people of the North would come under the dominion and cultural influence of Hurrio-Urartan groups for hundreds of years. Only now have they regained their complete independence. Only Adad knows what this remnant of a time long past will bring to this new world."
 tukri_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Animal-Skinned"
 tukri_heritage_desc:0 "From the Middle Bronze Age onwards, since the reign of Hammurabi, the Mesopotamians have called the tribes north of the Lullu as the Tukru, or the Turukkum. Culturally, not much is known about these people, however descriptions from the Hurrians describe them as semi-nomadic mountainmen who were distinct for their animal-skin clothing."
 lullu_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Lullubi Kingdom"
 lullu_heritage_desc:0 "The warlike mountain-people called the Lullu are said to have once ruled a Kingdom atop the hills. The semi-legendary kingdom would exist in some form from 2400 BCE to 600 BCE; however usually in the form of a Tribal Kingdom rather than that of a true kingdom. Regardless, the presence of the Lullu is well known by their Mesopotamian counterparts, having several armed conflicts against the Assyrians especially."
 gutia_heritage:0 "Heritage of Neo-Guteans"
 gutia_heritage_desc:0 "The name 'Gutian' may bring imagery of the long gone rulers of Akkad and Sumer, but be not fooled, these are not the same Gutians. The term 'Gutian' was used for a region of the Zagros Mountains, later referring to the largely Median tribes. Overtime, these 'Gutio-Medians' became distinct enough from their settled counterparts, more resembling their fellow Zagrossian tribes than the 'civilized' empires and kingdoms to their east."
 kassite_heritage:0 "Kassite Heritage"
 kassite_heritage_desc:0 "The Cossaeans are sometimes believed to be the successors to the mysterious people who ruled the Babylonians, the Kassites. Carrying on this legacy, the Cossaeans are among the fiercest tribes in the mountains. Their land, unfertile and difficult, has caused them to require a certain policy of land-piracy, so to speak. Skilled with the bow and arrow. They are also known to sometimes lend their might towards their possible cousins, the Elamites; especially if its against their adversaries in Babylon."

 syracusan_2_heritage_desc:0 "Seen as incompetent by many, including several of his supporters, Agothokles’ tyranny has come to an end. After being ostracized, the tyrant has seized control of the small island of Kossoura, with many of his supporters fleeing with him. Now, he plans for his return to Syracuse, and an end to the democratic upstarts. Perhaps the pirate Ptolemy will be able to assist him in his mission…"
 nura_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Punic Refuge"
 nura_heritage_desc:0 "A major trading hub, the Nuran population has swelled from refugees fleeing the newly Numidian controlled lands in North Africa. With the fall of Carthage as a major power, and the Punicsf Tyrian ‘overlords’ nowhere to be seen, it appears that Nura is now the leader of the Punics. In the Punic majority south, the residents live a life similar to pre-invasion North Africa. In the north of the island, the Nuragic tribes still maintain a fierce control of the land, and in the Nuran controlled areas, the tribesmen have been resisting their Punic overlords, by violent means. It seems the Nurans must act quickly, lest they have the same fate as many of their African brethren."
 aleria_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Determined Defenders"
 aleria_heritage_desc:0 "Founded by the Phocaeans in 566 BCE, Alalia was in a well positioned harbor named ‘The Syracusium’. The Etruscans had settled on this harbor earlier, founding the city of Nicea. Naturally, the Etruscans and the Greeks did not get along well. The Etruscans sent a fleet of 100 ships and an invasion force to Alalia to force the Greeks out of the island. Against all odds, the inferior Phocaean navy of 70 ships valiantly held back the Etruscan invaders, albeit with heavy casualties. However, the Etruscans returned with another fleet of ships and another army. With no navy to defend themselves, it appeared that the Greeks would be vanquished. With their backs to the wall, they feigned surrender, and hid in the city. As soon as the Etruscan army entered the city walls to accept their surrender. The defenders swarmed out of their hiding places, taking the invading force completely by surprise. The Etruscan army was slaughtered, and their fleet was captured. The Phocaeans quickly marched their army south, to the settlement of Nicea. The settlement fell quickly, and the residents were captured. No other force has threatened the sovereignty of Alalia since."

 mago_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Ignored Paradise"
 mago_heritage_desc:0 "Almost completely dependent on their Massaliot overlords, the Greeks of Mago inhabit little more than a glorified naval base. The residents of this little-known colony are not good fighters, or very good sailors. The one thing they have going for them is great beauty and serenity of the island. Amongst the Magoans, it is said that even Narcissus would stop looking at his reflection to bask in the beauty of the island."
 dertossa_heritage:0 "Heritage of the Lost Greeks"
 dertossa_heritage_desc:0 "Situated on the river Iberus, Dertossa was founded when a group of settlers from Korinthos set sail for Massalia, but they went off course and landed in Hibera. Although they did not land at their intended destination, they decided that the site was good enough. Trade from the inland Iberian tribes keeps Dertossa prosperous. The residents of Dertossa maintain good relations with the native Ilercavonians, and they are seen on a near equal level as Greeks."
 malacan_heritage:0 "Heritage of Abundant Gold"
 malacan_heritage_desc:0 "The Spanians of Malaca use the abundant iron and gold mines in their territory to great effect, amassing huge amounts of wealth. Every day, thousands of slaves in the various mines go to work, and extract ore. In order to maintain a sufficient workforce, slaves are given much less autonomy than in other Punic colonies, resulting in much more slave unrest than usual. With this abundant workforce, the Malacans have put them to good use, building many new mines, farms, and infrastructure projects."
 carteian_heritage:0 "Heritage of Mixed Iberia"
 carteian_heritage_desc:0 "In the culturally rich Iberian south, Greeks, Punics, and Iberians intermingle. The city of Carteia has a proud heritage of granting citizen rights to all of its inhabitants, regardless of group. This diverse arrangement has worked out well for Carteia, ensuring good relations with the various Punic, Greek, and Iberian states around it."
 indiketian_heritage:0 "Heritage of Indiketia "
 indiketian_heritage_desc:0 "The Indiketian people benefited enormously from trade with foreign powers, notably the Etruscans and Phoenicians and eventually the Massalians. The Indiketians had a unique relationship with the Massalians in Emporion and Rhode, stemming from the colonies' establishment on Indiketian territory and with Indiketian assistance. Indiketia learned much from its Hellenic neighbors and eagerly adopted their metallurgical techniques and pottery style. The Indiketians were famous for coating most of their pottery with white paint, while using imported pigments for detail-work. Notably, Indiketia's capital city, Indika, seems to have once been nestled on an small island that has since become part of the mainland as debris built up over the centuries."
