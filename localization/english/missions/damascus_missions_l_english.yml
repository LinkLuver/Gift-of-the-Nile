 damascus_missions:0 "The Children of Haze'il"
 damascus_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "Centuries ago, our forefather #Y Haze'il#! established himself as king of #Y Damascus#!, and brought her to unparalleled heights. Yet he failed to secure his kingdom against the passage of time and with his death came a rebellion among his former vassals, this combined with #E Assyrian#! invasion saw his kingdom brought to ruin. With the collapse of #E Assyria#! came the rule of the #E Urartians#!, under whom our kingdom managed to rebuild itself as a wealthy, yet still minor power. Then came the dominance of #E Kummuh#! and #E Bit Adini#!, who in recent years have begun to deplete themselves in constant wars against each other, perhaps it is time for #Y Damascus#! to once more champion the cause of a united, #Y Aramaic Kingdom#!?"
 damascus_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when Damascus has secured itself as the dominant power in #E Aram#! and #E Canaan#!."
 damascus_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Heed the call of the lord of heaven."
 
 #Missions
 
 damascus_missions_task_1:0 "Pan-Aramaic Congress"
 damascus_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "For centuries the vision of a unification of the #E Arameans#! in the face of their oppressors has seemed just barely at the edge of feasibility. With both us and our friends in #E Bit Agushi#! working tirelessly to achieve it. After the decline of #E Urartu#! we found ourselves forming an alliance with #E Tadmor#! and managed to enjoy an era of peace. Yet a vestige of the #E Assyrian#! threat would return, as the loyalists in Bit Adini refused to acknowledge their empire had lost the region, and, finding common ground with the #E Hammathites#!, launched an immensely bloody series of campaigns to bring an end to the independence of #E Bit Agushi#! who had for so long sought to undermine #E Assyrian#! rule. In recent years the kingdom of #E Kummuh#! has also enjoyed a renaissance, and her kings have styled themselves as the Great Kings of the #E Hittites#!. Amidst this chaos, perhaps we should hold a congress in #E Haleb#! to propose a new, more permanent league?"
 
 damascus_missions_task_2:0 "A New Canaanite Policy?"
 damascus_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "Our relationship with the southerners has been a rather rocky one throughout history. Allies of convenience against the Assyrians, the #E Samaritans#! have also envied our wealth, and after the death of #E Haze'il#! their betrayal brought ruin to our kingdom. A century ago, under #E Pareqi-Hadad#! we sacked their capital and installed a more reliable dynasty. Yet this time our ruin came not from the scheming of treacherous monarchs, but from popular distrust of our regime. Culminating in the exile of our friends to #E Galilee#!, and a rule by priests and judges. We now face ourselves facing two choices here, do we seek a restoration of our friends? Or should we cease operating through ineffectual intermediaries and bring #E Samaria#! directly into our kingdom?"
 
 damascus_missions_task_3:0 "A More Direct Approach"
 damascus_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "Our #E Galilaean#! vassals have proven ineffectual in maintaining control over #E Samaria#!, and the alternative of allowing our #E Samaritan#! rivals to dominate the region and continue to oppose us is unappealing. Thus, we have decided to bring an end to their independence, and to bring #E Samaria#! fully into the fold."
 
 damascus_missions_task_4:0 "Prepare for Invasion"
 damascus_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "In order to sustain our new direct approach towards our southern neighbors, we should build up our holdings in #E Galilee#!, both to support the force necessary to finally and fully subdue the #E Samaritans#!, and as a foundation for future campaigns in the region."
 
 damascus_missions_task_5:0 "Invade Sons of Abraham"
 damascus_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "#E Samaria#! has long been our enemy, we might have fought side by side at #E Qarqar#! centuries ago, but with the fall of Assyria we have long since reverted to our old rivalry. Most foolishly demonstrated when they accepted the fleeing pretender #E Nuhri-Shamesh#!, provoking #E Pareqi-Hadad#! and his #E Qedarite#! allies to invade their kingdom and impose a harsh tribute on them. It is time to bring an end to this, and bring the entirety of the south into our dominion."
 
 damascus_missions_task_6:0 "Invade Sons of Lot"
 damascus_missions_task_6_DESC:0 "After the siege of #E Samaria#!, the #E Ammonites#! allied with the #E Hamathites#! and #E Moabites#! to try to break our dominion. While they failed to retake the city, the prolonged conflict exhausted us and prevented us from stopping the #E Samaritan#! revolt. The time has come to break the House of Lot and bring its territory fully into the fold."
 
 damascus_missions_task_7:0 "Damascene Jerusalem"
 damascus_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "We have successfully subdued our Canaanite neighbors, and now find ourselves faced with the burden of controlling the region. We should rebuild and repopulate the royal cities of Samaria and Jerusalem to serve as the centers of our administration in the region."
 
 damascus_missions_task_8:0 "Temples for the Hebrews"
 damascus_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "Jerusalem has long held prestige as the abode and the favored city of 'Il, the creator of the world. We should rebuild his holy places in the hope of gaining his favor and smoothing the transition to our rule."
 
 damascus_missions_task_9:0 "Befriend Galilee"
 damascus_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "While they failed to hold on to Samaria, we were perhaps too harsh in the tribute we demanded from our Friends to the south. Better to have a loyal Samaria than to leave the south vulnerable to invasions by the Qedarites and Canaanites after all."
 
 damascus_missions_task_10:0 "War with Israelites"
 damascus_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "The time has come to restore the kingdom of Samaria, surely our lord will guide us to victory."
 
 damascus_missions_task_11:0 "War with Lotites"
 damascus_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "We have not forgotten the many transgressions that we and our friends have endured by the hands of the Ammonite kings, we must subdue this kingdom before they seek once more to undermine our allies."
 
 damascus_missions_task_12:0 "Fate of Northern Canaan"
 damascus_missions_task_12_DESC:0 "We have slain the rulers of Ammon and Israel, and emerged triumphant in Canaan. Now we must decide what to do with the conquered territories. Our Galilaean vassals will surely expect the restoration of their former lands, but perhaps we should also reward them with the land of Ammon? They have proven loyal and it is remote from our territory. We should also use our newfound ascension to demand the submission of Judah and the Canaanite trade cities."
 
 damascus_missions_task_13:0 "Sponser Asherahism"
 damascus_missions_task_13_DESC:0 "The Galilaens worship the wife of #E Ba'l#!, #E Asherah#! above all other deities. By sponsoring temples for their beloved #E Goddess#!, we will please them and they shall forever be our loyal subjects."
 
 damascus_missions_task_14:0 "Sponser Samaritan Reconstruction"
 damascus_missions_task_14_DESC:0 "If we are to avoid a repeat of our previous catastrophe, we should perhaps endeavor to aid in the reconstruction of the city of Samaria. By this means we will endear ourselves to the locals and strengthen our hold over the south."
 
 damascus_missions_task_15:0 "Lord of the Sunset"
 damascus_missions_task_15_DESC:0 "We have come to dominate much of the west, and have wholly undone our previous failures. Not even Haze'il could have boasted of a victory as complete as ours! The merchant-kingdoms of Tyre and Sidon prosper under our rule, and none of the Canaanite states are capable of opposing us. Truly, the sun has set on our affliction, and will soon dawn on a new era of prosperity!"
 
 damascus_missions_task_16:0 "Shatter the House of Zakkur"
 damascus_missions_task_16_DESC:0 "On the death of our great king Haze'il, a rebellion started in our northern vassal of Hamath led by Zakkur the Anaean. Rising to power in the city of Hadrak, he soon found support in much of Hamath and Lugath, and sought to court the Assyrians against us. Our failure to dislodge him led to a rebellion in our other vassals, and soon our kingdom had fallen to ruin. Although Hamath would later prove instrumental in aiding the Urartians in breaking Assyrian power across the Prat, we have not forgotten their betrayal and the damage it caused us. Now, with our Qedarite and Yahanean allies, we can finally end this rebellion."

 damascus_missions_task_17:0 "Liberate Sem'el"
 damascus_missions_task_17_DESC:0 "Sem'el, the capital of Yadiya, has not been treated well by the passage of time. Once a prosperous if small kingdom, it was betrayed by its ruling dynasty to the Assyrians, and suffered much as a result. The city was devastated by the Urartians during the war against Assyria, and had an Urartian king installed to ensure local order. Since the fall of Urartu, it has found itself changing orbit between Gurgum, Que, and Hamath, and has been the site of frequent wars between them. We should free it from its current overlords so that it might be enjoy a respite from its affliction and be rebuilt to its former glory."

 damascus_missions_task_18:0 "Fate of the North"
 damascus_missions_task_18_DESC:0 "With our recent triumphs, our allies have come to expect some reward for their aid in this matter. Perhaps we might consider ceding some part of Lugath and Yadiya to Bit Agushi in exchange for their recognition of our claim to Aramean primacy? Or perhaps we no longer need to cooperate with lesser kings."

 damascus_missions_task_19:0 "Restoration of Aram"
 damascus_missions_task_19_DESC:0 "Finally, after centuries of hardship, oppression, and war, the Arameans are unified around a single state. Now we must take advantage of this brief peace to rebuild our lands, so that when the time comes we might bring an end to the tyrants of Bit Adini and of Kummuh, and never again find ourselves subjected to the foreign yoke."

 #Events
 me_damascus_1_title:0 "The Pan-Aramaic Congress"
 me_damascus_1_desc:0 "A century ago, the league of Haleb, consisting of Damascus, Tadmor, and Bit Agushi dominated the Levant. However, the league splintered when Bit Adini invaded Bit Agushi, with the death of king Amur'Il during the battle of Arpad. Initially it seemed that perhaps Bit Adini would succeed where their Assyrian masters had once failed, but their invasion of Tadmor saw less success and soon they found themselves at war with the Hittites and Armenians.\n\n In recent years Bit Agushi has managed to slip out from the Assyrian yoke once more. It is time to reform the old alliance with them and Tadmor, and perhaps go even further!"

 me_damascus_104_desc:0 "The Syriac Kingdom of Bit Agushi has agreed to join our congress."
 me_damascus_105_title:0 "Reach out to our seafaring cousins?"
 me_damascus_105_desc:0 "With the increasingly aggressive kingdom of Que regularly fighting with out coastal neighbors, it is possible that they may be willing to join our league. This presents a number of advantages to us, as while these states are not especially powerful, they do possess a great deal of wealth. Not to mention the benefits of us having access to a port, and us further isolating the Hamathites. We should invite them to the league."
 me_damascus_105.a:0 "Invite Alalakh"
 me_damascus_105.b:0 "Invite Ugarit"
 me_damascus_105.c:0 "Invite Arados"
 me_damascus_106_title:0 "Pan-Aramaic Congress: Port"
 me_damascus_106_desc:0 "The Pan-Aramaic Congress sponsored by the Damascene Kingdom of Aram have sent us a peculiar option; joining their league. While we share more in common with our brothers to the south, the influence of the Aramaic and Hittite states are indeed prominent. Should we really consider joining their little club?"
 me_damascus_106.a:0 "It can only be a good thing."

 me_damascus_107.a:0 "Excellent!"
 
 me_damascus_2_title:0 "A Change in Policy?"
 me_damascus_2_desc:0 "Our rule in #E Samaria#! was never very firm or popular, only kept in place because the dynasty installed by #E Pareqi-Hadad#! was already controversial, and the great successes under that king. After his death the kingdom fell into near constant revolt, and would ultimately disintegrate while we were exhausted by our wars with Hamath and Ammon and distracted by our intervention against Bit Agushi. The kingdom of Galilee is all that remains of this venture, and with our recent stabilization we find ourselves questioning the need for this rump state. Perhaps it is time to end it and destroy the kingdom of #E Samaria#! permanently? Or perhaps we should take a more active hand in our subject's affairs? It may be easier than having to occupy all of this by ourselves after all."
 me_damascus_2.a:0 "Let us reconsider our approach."

 me_damascus_3_desc:0 "The current status quo in Canaan is not sustainable,  our proxy in Galilee is unstable and widely hated, and will surely collapse the hour we look away from the region. For this cause [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|E] has opted to bring it directly under our rule, and to bring an end to the kingdom of Samaria forever."

A grand arsenal, where the mighty host of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] will assemble and make ready for the campaign. A multitude of horses are stored here, as are many implements of war. Finally, will we be able to sustain a force capable of ending the kingdom of Samaria, and bring all of Canaan directly into our fold."

 me_damascus_6_desc:0 "The Ammonites were cunning rivals of the league of Haleb, even after Hamath was forced to pay tribute by Amur'il they continued to harbor a number of claimants and opponents to Damascene rule. While few of these would prove very popular with the rebels who came to dominate the land, it still did not aid in Damascus' efforts to collaborate with their southern neighbors. With the collapse of Ammon and their southern neighbors, a major sanctuary for the opposition has been shattered,"
 me_damascus_6.a:0 "Excellent!"

The city has been rebuilt as the jewel of the kingdom's Canaanite holdings, and a capital second only to Damascus itself! A testimony to the justice of our rule and a base from which we will strike down any future rebellion."

 me_damascus_9_desc:0 "Established in the aftermath of the death of Amur'Il from the ruins of the kingdom of Samaria. Galilee is a rather unstable state. Preserved from disintegration mainly from local religious disagreements with their southern neighbors as well as an intervention by the king of Damascus and the neighboring Qedarites. The kingdom owes its continued existence to Damascus, and has the potential to be rebuilt into a loyal vassal through which the domination of Canaan will be achieved."

 me_damascus_10_title:0 "The restoration of Samaria"
 me_damascus_10_desc:0 "The kingdom of Samaria collapsed into a theocratic state founded on the view that the god 'Il was the only ruler suitable to operate as king, and that the state should much rather be ruled solely by his divinely appointed intermediaries. This has led to the birth of a state radically opposed to our rule, as such [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|E] has opted to overthrow it and bring about the reestablishment of the dynasty first installed by Pareqi-Hadad."

So long as they and their Moabite allies remain independent, they will continue to rise up against us, threatening to cut short our resurgence. If our rule is to have any hope of lasting in the region then we must ensure that they also are brought into the fold."

Now, having learned from these mistakes, we have not only come to dominate these lands, but have established ourselves a kingdom which even the Assyrians in their prime would fear! After centuries of constant conflict and invasion, Damascus has emerged as the dominant power in the lands west of the Euphrates.

Now, we have the chance to reward their loyalty by ceding to them some of our more remote northern possessions, in exchange for them fully endorsing our claim to Aramaic primacy. However, relying on unreliable vassals and tributaries has been a failing of many previous Damascene kings, most notably with the downfall of Bar-Hadad III after the death of Haze'il."

A promise of continued prosperity so long as the kingdom endures, and of immense retribution against all who would turn against it. /n/n Meanwhile, in the north, where Qarqar once stood, a monument has been erected to our independence. The city of Hamath enjoys renewed prosperity due to its renewed trade ties with Damascus and Tadmor, and the Assyrian state of Bit Adini finds itself isolated and contained.
