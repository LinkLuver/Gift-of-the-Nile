 akhetaton_missions:0 "Restorers of the Light"
 akhetaton_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "The final remnant of the last golden age of Egypt #E (Late Kingdom Egypt)#!, the #E 27th Dynasty#! was an #Y Atenic#! traditionalist dynasty responsible for a major ressurgence of #Y Akhenaten's#! religion. While #E Kemet#! was indeed great in the earlier #E 27th#!, the later kings of #E Akhetaton#! were plagued by extreme genetic failure stemming from their preference for #Y Thutmosid#! brides. The ancient familial line is tied to #Y Akhenaten#! himself, but it appears as though the old gods are having their revenge upon the #Y Atenists#!.\n\nYet, #Y Aten's#! light has yet to fade from the open temple in #E Akhetaton#!. And where there's a glimmer of light, there is a glimmer of hope; and that hope is the revival of #E Kemet#! under the #E Pharaoh#! in #E Akhetaton#!. To do so, we must defeat the #E Henen-Nesutans#!, the #E Wasetians#!, and reunite the #E Delta#!. A tall order indeed, but it must be done for the destruction of #E Isfet#! and prominence of the #Y Aten#!."
 akhetaton_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when #E Kemet#! is united under the #E 27th Dynasty of Egypt#! lead by the light of #Y Aten#!."

 #Missions
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_1:0 "The Dying Dynasty"
 akhetaton_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "The #E 27th Dynasty#! is the last remnant of the once great #E Late Kingdom#! of Kemet. Thus, it's perhaps no surprise that the dynastic line itself seems at a very advanced age. The issues of fertility plague the Queen, while the King himself too seems no longer fertile enough to produce an offspring. The next #E Pharaoh#! to be is thus a woman. This is not unheard of, however, the timing could not be worse with the decline of the #E 27th Dynasty#!. Luckily #E Iqrefaten IV Iqrefatid#! has an idea; step down from most of his #E Pharaonic#! roles and let #E Ankhsenebaten II Iqrefatid#! handle the state's affairs. It's risky, but it may be the only way to preserve the dynasty."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_2:0 "Curse of the Old Gods"
 akhetaton_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "To get rid of the #R Curse of the Old Gods#!, we have been given a simple solution; we must marry a lowborn, and only then will the curse be lifted. Thus, the chosen lowborn of the #Y Aten#! will be selected and with that, a babe shall be born in the light of #E Akhetaton#!, and the succession will be secured."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_3:0 "Faith of Pharaoh"
 akhetaton_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "A good Pharaoh must be adiquette in matters of faith... especially nowadays. The father of the Pharaoh and previous Pharaoh #E Iqrefaten#! would make a great teacher for his daughter in this regard."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_4:0 "Might of Pharaoh"
 akhetaton_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "The Pharaoh has to be powerful and mighty, lest her subjects not obey her! We need to hire someone capable enough to teach #E Ankhsenebaten#! the ways of war."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_5:0 "Care of Pharaoh"
 akhetaton_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "A Pharaoh must let the realm prosper, flourishing it with life as the #E Aten#! intended. Let #E Ankhsenebaten#! start her first construction project in #Y Akhetaton#!."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_6:0 "People of Pharaoh"
 akhetaton_missions_task_6_DESC:0 "The Pharoah needs a strong support system. She will need these friends to trust in this life, and only the most loyal companions will do!"
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_7:0 "Convince Per-Medjed Nome"
 akhetaton_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "Per-Medjed Nome would be a great ally to defeat the Henen-Nesutans, however, it is undoubtable that those #E Faiyumic#! heretics want to beat us to it. Let us convince Per-Medjed Nome to join us."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_8:0 "Faiyumic Reconquest"
 akhetaton_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "The #E Faiyum#! is the greatest holdout of the #Y Aten#! outside of #E Amarna#! itself. The Pharaoh of #E Henen-Hesut#! must be crushed, as should the heretical faith worshipping #G Sobek#! as the #Y Aten#! itself! The blasphemy..."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_9:0 "A Grand Divination"
 akhetaton_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "It is well known that the curse of the old gods plagues the #E 27th Dynasty#!. Who knows why, but the #E Thutmosid#! line, as pureblood as it is, seems to be unable to sustain itself any longer! But the Aten is stronger, all gods will yeild to the one true god #Y Aten#!, and His prophet, #Y Akhenaten#!! We must pray that any child of #E Ankhsenebaten II Iqrefatid#! is not cursed any longer."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_10:0 "Tale of Three"
 akhetaton_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "Three dynasaties vying for power in the Nile, and we are one of them. Let us evaluate strategies to get ahead of the other two. One a heathen, the other a heretic."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_11:0 "Prepare for the Worst"
 akhetaton_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "The #Y Waset#! false Pharaoh is our most immediate concern. They undoubtedly have a larger powerbase than we do, and we should prepare for an invasion from the Upper Egyptians by fortifying the Eastern coast of #E Akhetaton#!."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_12:0 "Allies Up the Nile"
 akhetaton_missions_task_12_DESC:0 "In order to defeat the powerful #E Wasetians#!, looking for allies in #E Nubia#! may be helpful. Let us send a message up the #Y Nile#! through the desert passes and see who responds to our allegience request."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_13:0 "War on Waset"
 akhetaton_missions_task_13_DESC:0 "The time has finally come to declare war on the worst of all #E Heathens#!, the eternal city of the Hidden One, #Y Amun#! protects them. Yet the #Y Aten#! is the greatest of all gods, He is the one true god! Thus, He will lead us to victory."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_14:0 "Punish the Heathens?"
 akhetaton_missions_task_14_DESC:0 "Now that we have the city of #E Waset#!, we must decide what to do with them. They will try their hardest to reject the worship of the #Y Aten#!... yet, perhaps we can convince them otherwise? Or shall we just #R burn the lot of them#! instead? It surely would be easier."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_15:0 "Off the Beaten Pass"
 akhetaton_missions_task_15_DESC:0 "While our priorities are restoring our rule over the #Y Nile#!, we could consolodate our power by reconquering the oases and deserts."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_16:0 "Convert the Heathens"
 akhetaton_missions_task_16_DESC:0 "With our power over the #Y Oases#! of #E Kemet#!, we can use them as a glorious #E Beacon of Light#! to project #Y Atenism#! all over the so-called lands of #Y Set#!. We need only give these lands a push towards the way of the light, and they will serve us well."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_17:0 "The Aten in Siwa"
 akhetaton_missions_task_17_DESC:0 "The #E Siwa Oasis#! has always been the center of the cult of #Y Ammon-Ra#!, the #E Hidden One#!, who has become the greatest enemy of us #Y Atenists#!. By conquering #E Siwa#! we have further legitimized our claims over #E Kemetic Egypt#! as well. Now, let us replace the old #Y Ammon-Ra#! worship with worship of our own #E Pharaoh#!."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_18:0 "City of Tutankhaten"
 akhetaton_missions_task_18_DESC:0 "The city of #E Per-Aten#! was once owned by a nomarch, however, it was divided between the #E Hut-Waret Nome#! and #E Mafkat Khetiu#!. Regardless, their capital city of #E Per-Aten#! was a beautiful one indeed. Dedicateed to the late son of #E Akhenaten#!, #E Tutankhaten#!, the city was adorned with a funerary temple, as well as an unrelated but still important, port of the Sun. We should invest in them if applicable, otherwise, we should take the city ourselves."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_19:0 "City of the Dazzling Aten"
 akhetaton_missions_task_19_DESC:0 "Perhaps the greatest #Y Atenic#! city outside of #E Akhetaton#! itself, the city of #E Awnu#! is said to have been made by the prophet. Additionally, the mighty #E Pillars of Atum#! stand next to the #E Temple of the Elevated Aten#!. The city will be a valuable asset, and we should invest in them if applicable, otherwise, we should take the city ourselves."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_20:0 "City of Neferneferuaten"
 akhetaton_missions_task_20_DESC:0 "The city of #E Per-Merit#! has a unique tradition of #Y Sun-Dancing#!. It gave birth to a new artstyle, music, and a general cultural hub mixing the more rigid #E Faiyumic#! and #E Akhetatonian#! #Y Atenism#! with the colors and sounds of traditional #Y Kemetism#! and the hustle of trade. We should invest in them if applicable, otherwise, we should take the city ourselves."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_21:0 "Sunrise in the Delta"
 akhetaton_missions_task_21_DESC:0 "There was once a league of #E Nomarchs#! called the #Y Sunset League#!, holding the torch of the #Y Aten#! against the #E Kemetic#! heathens. Now that we have showed our commitment and success in the Upper Delta, as well as investments and territories important for #Y Atenism#!, the #Y Sunset League#! and all #Y Atenic#! countries may now return to the great #E Pharaoh of the Aten#!!"
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_22:0 "The Restorer of Light"
 akhetaton_missions_task_22_DESC:0 "We have restored the light of the #Y Aten#! to #E Kemet#!! The #E 4th Intermediate Period#! shall be ended by our hands. #Y Aten#! bless the #E Pharaohs#! of the #E 27th#! dynasty of #E Egypt#!!"
