 akhetaton_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "The final remnant of the last golden age of Egypt #E (Late Kingdom Egypt)#!, the #E 27th Dynasty#! was an #Y Atenic#! traditionalist dynasty responsible for a major ressurgence of #Y Akhenaten's#! religion. While #E Kemet#! was indeed great in the earlier #E 27th#!, the later kings of #E Akhetaton#! were plagued by extreme genetic failure stemming from their preference for #Y Thutmosid#! brides. The ancient familial line is tied to #Y Akhenaten#! himself, but it appears as though the old gods are having their revenge upon the #Y Atenists#!.\n\nYet, #Y Aten's#! light has yet to fade from the open temple in #E Akhetaton#!. And where there's a glimmer of light, there is a glimmer of hope; and that hope is the revival of #E Kemet#! under the #E Pharaoh#! in #E Akhetaton#!. To do so, we must defeat the #E Henen-Nesutans#!, the #E Wasetians#!, and reunite the #E Delta#!. A tall order indeed, but it must be done for the destruction of #E Isfet#! and prominence of the #Y Aten#!."

 akhetaton_missions_task_1:0 "The Dying Dynasty"
 akhetaton_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "The #E 27th Dynasty#! is the last remnant of the once great #E Late Kingdom#! of Kemet. Thus, it's perhaps no surprise that the dynastic line itself seems at a very advanced age. The issues of fertility plague the Queen, while the King himself too seems no longer fertile enough to produce an offspring. The next #E Pharaoh#! to be is thus a woman. This is not unheard of, however, the timing could not be worse with the decline of the #E 27th Dynasty#!. Luckily #E Iqrefaten IV Iqrefatid#! has an idea; step down from most of his #E Pharaonic#! roles and let #E Ankhsenebaten II Iqrefatid#! handle the state's affairs. It's risky, but it may be the only way to preserve the dynasty."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_2:0 "Curse of the Old Gods"
 akhetaton_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "To get rid of the #R Curse of the Old Gods#!, we have been given a simple solution; we must marry a lowborn, and only then will the curse be lifted.

 akhetaton_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "Per-Medjed Nome would be a great ally to defeat the Henen-Nesutans, however, it is undoubtable that those #E Faiyumic#! heretics want to beat us to it. Let us convince Per-Medjed Nome to join us."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_8:0 "Faiyumic Reconquest"
 akhetaton_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "The #E Faiyum#! is the greatest holdout of the #Y Aten#! outside of #E Amarna#! itself. The Pharaoh of #E Henen-Hesut#! must be crushed, as should the heretical faith worshipping #G Sobek#! as the #Y Aten#! itself! The blasphemy..."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_9:0 "A Grand Divination"
 akhetaton_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "It is well known that the curse of the old gods plagues the #E 27th Dynasty#!. Who knows why, but the #E Thutmosid#! line, as pureblood as it is, seems to be unable to sustain itself any longer! But the Aten is stronger, all gods will yeild to the one true god #Y Aten#!, and It's prophet, #Y Akhenaten#!!

 akhetaton_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "The #Y Waset#! false Pharaoh is our most immediate concern. They undoubtedly have a larger powerbase than we do, and we should prepare for an invasion from the Upper Egyptians by fortifying the Eastern coast of #E Akhetaton#!."

We need only give these lands a push towards the way of the light, and they will serve us well."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_17:0 "The Aten in Siwa"
 akhetaton_missions_task_17_DESC:0 "The #E Siwa Oasis#! has always been the center of the cult of #Y Ammon-Ra#!, the #E Hidden One#!, who has become the greatest enemy of us #Y Atenists#!. By conquering #E Siwa#! we have further legitimized our claims over #E Kemetic Egypt#! as well. Now, let us replace the old #Y Ammon-Ra#! worship with worship of a local priest of the #Y Aten."

 akhetaton_missions_task_18_DESC:0 "The city of #E Per-Aten#! was once owned by a nomarch, however, it was divided between the #E Hut-Waret Nome#! and #E Mafkat Khetiu#!.

 akhetaton_missions_task_19_DESC:0 "Perhaps the greatest #Y Atenic#! city outside of #E Akhetaton#! itself, the city of #E Awnu#! is said to have been made by the prophet.

 akhetaton_missions_task_20:0 "City of Neferneferuaten"
 akhetaton_missions_task_20_DESC:0 "The city of #E Per-Merit#! has a unique tradition of #Y Sun-Dancing#!. It gave birth to a new artstyle, music, and a general cultural hub mixing the more rigid #E Faiyumic#! and #E Akhetatonian#! #Y Atenism#! with the colors and sounds of traditional #Y Kemetism#! and the hustle of trade. We should invest in them if applicable, otherwise, we should take the city ourselves.\n\n#G The city must be owned by an #E Atenic#! nation.#!"
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_21:0 "Sunrise in the Delta"
 akhetaton_missions_task_21_DESC:0 "There was once a league of #E Nomarchs#! called the #Y Sunset League#!, holding the torch of the #Y Aten#! against the #E Kemetic#! heathens.
