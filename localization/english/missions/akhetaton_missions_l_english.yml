 akhetaton_missions:0 "Restorers of the Light"
 akhetaton_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "The final remnant of the last golden age of Egypt #E (Late Kingdom Egypt)#!, the #E 27th Dynasty#! was an #Y Atenic#! traditionalist dynasty responsible for a major ressurgence of #Y Akhenaten's#! religion. While #E Kemet#! was indeed great in the earlier #E 27th#!, the later kings of #E Akhetaton#! were plagued by extreme genetic failure stemming from their preference for #Y Thutmosid#! brides. The ancient familial line is tied to #Y Akhenaten#! himself, but it appears as though the old gods are having their revenge upon the #Y Atenists#!.\n\nYet, #Y Aten's#! light has yet to fade from the open temple in #E Akhetaton#!. And where there's a glimmer of light, there is a glimmer of hope; and that hope is the revival of #E Kemet#! under the #E Pharaoh#! in #E Akhetaton#!. To do so, we must defeat the #E Henen-Nesutans#!, the #E Wasetians#!, and reunite the #E Delta#!. A tall order indeed, but it must be done for the destruction of #E Isfet#! and prominence of the #Y Aten#!."
 akhetaton_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when #E Kemet#! is united under the #E 27th Dynasty of Egypt#! lead by the light of #Y Aten#!."

 #Missions
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_1:0 "The Dying Dynasty"
 akhetaton_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "The #E 27th Dynasty#! is the last remnant of the once great #E Late Kingdom#! of Kemet. Thus, it's perhaps no surprise that the dynastic line itself seems at a very advanced age. The issues of fertility plague the Queen, while the King himself too seems no longer fertile enough to produce an offspring. The next #E Pharaoh#! to be is thus a woman. This is not unheard of, however, the timing could not be worse with the decline of the #E 27th Dynasty#!. Luckily #E Iqrefaten IV Iqrefatid#! has an idea; step down from most of his #E Pharaonic#! roles and let #E Ankhsenebaten II Iqrefatid#! handle the state's affairs. It's risky, but it may be the only way to preserve the dynasty."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_2:0 "Curse of the Old Gods"
 akhetaton_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "It is well known that the curse of the old gods plagues the #E 27th Dynasty#!. Who knows why, but the #E Thutmosid#! line, as pureblood as it is, seems to be unable to sustain itself any longer! But the Aten is stronger, all gods will yeild to the one true god #Y Aten#!, and His prophet, #Y Akhenaten#!! We must pray that any child of #E Ankhsenebaten II Iqrefatid#! is not cursed any longer."
 
 akhetaton_missions_task_3:0 "Faith of Pharaoh"
