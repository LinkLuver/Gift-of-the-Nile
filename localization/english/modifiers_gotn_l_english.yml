 alexandria:0 "Alexandria District"
 alexandria_desc:0 "Not all piracy is bad piracy... or so they say in Macedon. Macedonian pirates have gained repute all over the world they travel. In many countries, they have become merchants, citizens, and even state-employed officials. In fact, the benefits often outweigh the maluses, and in some cases, these former pirates often settle their own districts, colloquially called 'Alexandria Districts,' in honor of the King of Macedon, Alexander."

 found_the_museion_desc:0 "As the natural center of the Post-Alexandrine world the city of Alexandria already attracts many of the best and the brightest Hellenistic minds. We must embrace this role as the carrier of Greek culture and philosophy, and create a temple to the Muses themselves. In this Museion all texts ever written in Greek would be assembled, and any texts yet unknown to Greek scholarship translated.\nWhile it has been the ambition of many a great monarch to assemble a personal library worthy of admiration and envy, few have dared aim as high as this. Should we succeed our memory will live on for centuries, if not millennia."

Our architects have prepared the necessary documents for a massive statue in the honor of the god, that will forever protect the ports of Rhodes."
