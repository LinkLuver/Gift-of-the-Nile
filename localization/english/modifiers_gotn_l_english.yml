 alexandria_desc:0 "Not all piracy is bad piracy... or so they say in Macedon. Macedonian pirates have gained repute all over the world they travel. In many countries, they have become merchants, citizens, and even state-employed officials. In fact, the benefits often outweigh the maluses, and in some cases, these former pirates often settle their own districts, colloquially called 'Alexandria Districts,' in honor of the King of Macedon, Alexander."
