 found_the_museion_desc:0 "As the natural center of the Post-Alexandrine world the city of Alexandria already attracts many of the best and the brightest Hellenistic minds. We must embrace this role as the carrier of Greek culture and philosophy, and create a temple to the Muses themselves. In this Museion all texts ever written in Greek would be assembled, and any texts yet unknown to Greek scholarship translated.\nWhile it has been the ambition of many a great monarch to assemble a personal library worthy of admiration and envy, few have dared aim as high as this. Should we succeed our memory will live on for centuries, if not millennia."

We fought valiantly to beat back the oppressing invaders, and with the help of Akrephatenes (Iqrefaten) III of Egypt we managed to secure our independence.\n\nIt is time to thank the god for his help in protecting the island, and celebrate our victory. Our architects have prepared the necessary documents for a massive statue in the honor of the god, that will forever protect the ports of Rhodes."
